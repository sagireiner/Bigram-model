Awards and Classification - in Modular Programmes <p> 31.1 The following regulations apply to all new registrations from the 2010-11 academic year on an undergraduate programme so to calculate the final programme mark and/or degree classification .

We are working closely with our commercial partner AgriEnt Limited ( http : **25;602;TOOLONG ) . <p> Ticks and tick-borne disease <p> Apparent changes in tick distributions and the prevalence of tick borne disease ( TBD ) within Europe have been reported over the last 10-20 years . Climate change may be responsible in part for this , but changes in habitat management , host movement patterns and changes in abundance , particularly deer , may be equally important . The recent removal of compulsory tick treatment for companion animals entering the UK from continental Europe is a further factor which has raised fears about the potential for the introduction of new tick species or new tick-borne pathogens . Given the complexity of the **28;629;TOOLONG interactions , it is difficult to differentiate the impact of the various risk factors to allow confident predictions about future tick-borne disease epidemiology . In our ongoing studies we have examined the distribution and prevalence of ticks infesting domestic dogs in Great Britain ; the results show that 50% of veterinary practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random were carrying ticks and 15% of practices reported that more than 50% of dogs carried ticks . Borrelia was detected in 2% of ticks tested , Babesia spp. in 2% and Anaplasma in 2% . We are currently examining the potential for urban green spaces to act as epidemiological bottlenecks for TBD . Conservation strategies which encourage the greater integration of green-spaces into the urban a nd peri-urban environments and their management for wildlife and biodiversity , provide important recreational spaces but also facilitate an increase in abundance of hosts such as small mammals and deer . This is likely to lead to an increase in the abundance and distribution of ticks and an increased exposure of people and companion animals to ticks in environments such as gardens and parks . Changes may also be associated indirectly with social and economic trends , often mediated by climate , which influence outdoor activity , exposure and the risk of being bitten .

@@77496237 @6196237/ <h> 1 . Introduction <p> The purpose of this document is to provide both applicants for promotion , and those assessing cases , with further guidance on the application of the promotion criteria.This document should be read in conjunction with the criteria outlined in Section 3 of the Promotion Procedure . <p> Candidates are assessed against a criterion of excellence , the focus of which will vary according to the nature of the role . For staff on pathways 1 or 2 , the focus will be on demonstrating excellence in research , whereas for staff on pathway 3 , the focus will be on excellence in teaching and learning . In addition , in order to meet the overall criterion of excellence , all candidates must also demonstrate appropriate academic leadership and good citizenship . <h> 2 . Defining Excellence <p> The starting assumption is that all staff are performing at a satisfactory level . Excellence is therefore seen as performance that is qualitatively and decisively superior to satisfactory . However , it is recognised that excellence is not an absolute quality , measured by simple objective criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evidence provided . <p> In general , it is the quality of the contribution in the different areas of activity or roles undertaken , rather than the quantity of activity , that distinguishes excellence from satisfactory performance . <p> The following sections set out in general terms the kind of evidence that may demonstrate excellence . It is recognised that what is expected ( or what is possible ) will differ between faculties and between schools within faculties . It is also recognised that few , if any , people will be able to offer evidence on all the criteria suggested in any section . <h> 3 . Excellence in Research <p> Excellence in research , in the context of an overall case for excellence , will demonstrate work of originality which has made an observable impact on the subject . It is measured against output and should show a substantial body of work of international ( or where appropriate , national ) quality . <p> For promotion to a Personal Professorship on Pathway 1 and 2 the research achievement should be measured by standards of international comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demonstrate a high level of excellence in research , usually with an international profile . The quality of any research contribution on Pathway 3 should also be considered ( although may be at a reduced quantity ) . <p> What counts as substantial will differ from discipline to discipline . Heads of School should provide some guidance on this in their reports . Normally , there will be clear recognition from peers in the academic community of a candidates excellence . <p> It is not possible to draw up hard and fast rules about measuring the quality of research , but there should be evidence of some of the following : <p> publication in particularly prestigious journals or by leading publishing houses <p> Articles in refereed journals and books are the main form of communication in research . But they are not the only media , nor does a high volume of publication necessarily equate with excellence in research . Judging the quality of an individuals research output is a complex task and external assessors are critical in evaluating the corpus of an individuals scholarly work . Disciplines will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is published will occur between faculties and even between schools within faculties . For example , in those subjects closely related to information technology , the form of communication may be less dependent upon written articles . In other areas , the production of plays or the performance of musical works may count as outputs if they reflect a candidates research work . The impact , influence and value of research beyond academia can be very diverse in nature . e.g. raising the level of public discussion , adding to cultural life , influencing policy decisions , or making a step change in practice ( see Appendix One : Guidance and exemplars of engagement and impact ( PDF , 325kB ) ) . <p> In order to ensure as much fairness as possible , promotions committees will only evaluate publishedoutput . They will not take into consideration future plans , commitments or promise ( except when considering trajectory to a professorship , in cases of promotion to a readership ) . To be counted , publications must have been published , or be in press/accepted for publication . <h> Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a major part of the role being undertaken . Relevant examples that may be taken into account might include : <p> Managing resources <p> Successfully administering research grants <p> Helping colleagues bid for research grants , fellowships and consultancies <h> 4 . Excellence in Teaching and Learning <p> Excellence in teaching and learning in the context of an overall case for excellence , will show exceptional quality over a range of activities . Promotion will be achieved on the basis of outstanding contributions to leadership of teaching and learning . Excellent performance in teaching and related administration is also an essential prerequisite . <p> The individuals contribution to teaching and learning will be recognised nationally , and possibly internationally ( but in the case of the latter , this is much less likely than in the area of research ) . They will provide evidence of having been effective in improving teaching practice widely across the relevant subject(s) and will be engaged in scholarly activity and/or pedagogic research in their subject area and/or innovation . It will not be sufficient to have achieved only a high level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a clear qualitative distinction made between mere effectiveness in teaching and the achievements expected for a Pathway 3 Professorship . Excellence should have been demonstrated consistently over a sustained period . Evidence will normally demonstrate recognition beyond the University at a national level by national networks and/or academic or professional bodies . <p> A candidate would normally need to demonstrate evidence under the areas described below : <p> Leadership in the practice and theory of education in the individuals subject area , internally and externally . This may be at institutional and/or national level . <p> Excellent performance as a teacher demonstrated by excellent peer and student evaluation reports . <p> Practice has led to highly effective student learning in the individuals subject area over a sustained period . <p> Practice is creative and adaptable to changing circumstances , with examples of innovation that reflect national or international changes in the subject area . <p> Practice is extensively informed by a sustained , high quality contribution to discipline-based scholarly activity and/or research in teaching . <p> Practice is considered excellent with specific regard to the teaching expectations within that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including leadership in education that contributes to the professional development of others . ( e.g. through mentoring ; peer review and/or observation etc ) . <p> The extent to which the above factors are demonstrated by candidates on Pathway 1 will also count as a relevant contribution for their case for a promotion to professor on that Pathway . <h> Teaching related Administration <p> An excellent teacher is likely to show effective administration in the context of teaching . This might involve : <p> Taking responsibility for the overall direction of a unit/year/programme <p> Overseeing open days <p> Taking responsibility for student admissions <p> Liaising with central University processes on examinations and links with external examiners <h> 5 . Clinical contribution <p> Excellence in the performance of clinical duties will be taken into account only when undertaken for the University as employer .

Consequently , even those whose time is ( exceptionally ) 80 per cent clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are undertaken for the NHS , the assessment for promotion would be on the work done for the University with full regard for the time available for University duties . <p> Where clinical academic staff undertake clinical work for the University , clinical excellence should be assessed by reference to some or all of the following activities : <p> **25;689;TOOLONG leadership in the delivery of clinical service <p> Major contribution(s) to the development of new areas of clinical activity <p> Major contribution(s) to improvements , or introduction of innovation , to an existing area of clinical activity <p> Evidence of international/national recognition of excellence of clinical skills through invited consultancy activities <p> Evidence of innovation and contribution to knowledge by offering a substantial body of published works within international and national clinical refereed journals <p> Evidence by virtue of invitations to speak at international clinical conferences <p> Attainment of an international ( or national diploma ) in a clinical speciality e.g. a European Board or an RCVS Diploma ( veterinary clinical specialities only ) <p> Establishment of a record of successfully training diplomats in the specialist area .

Establishing and applying criteria for assessment at level 8 should be managed by the school that owns the associated programme , in liaison with the faculty and the Academic Director of Graduate Studies . <p> 12.7 The common marking criteria are designed to be used for an individual piece of assessed student work . The descriptors give broad comparability of standards by level of study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University . They reflect the QAA Framework for Higher Education Qualifications but need to be benchmarked against subject specific criteria at the programme level . <p> 12.8 Faculties , with their constituent schools , must establish appropriately specific and detailed marking criteria which are congruent with the University-level criteria and , if appropriate , the level of study . All forms of programme-specific marking criteria must be approved by the Faculty . <p> Marking scales <p> 12.9 Assessment must be marked using one of the sanctioned marking scales , as follows : <p> + 0-100 marking scale <p> + 0-20 marking scale <p> A five point A-E marking scale is available for those programmes which already utilise this scale where distinct grades of competence are being measured . Given the complexities in translating a grade in this type of scale to a percentage for the purposes of progression or classification , any new proposals to use the A-E scale requires a pedagogic rationale for doing so and the approval of the relevant Faculty Education Director and Academic Director of Studies . <p> Any mark on the chosen marking scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marking scale that is best suited to the form of assessment . This and the marking criteria for the assessment should be established prior to its commencement . <p> Exceptions to the sanctioned marking scales <p> 12.11 Neither the 0-20 nor 0-100 point scale is applicable to assessments where marks are not awarded ; the student either passes or not . Such assessment may be employed , subject to approval by the faculty , when a student is required to demonstrate a minimum standard of competence for reasons related to professional accreditation requirements . <p> 12.12 Highly structured assessments that are scored out of a total number less than 100 may be utilised where each mark can be justified in relation to those marks neighbouring it . In these cases the mark must be translated onto the 0-100 point scale , mapped against the relevant marking criteria , and students informed of the use of this method in advance of the assessment in the appropriate medium ( e.g. on Blackboard ) . <p> 12.13 Marks gauged on the 0-20 scale should be translated to a point on the 0-100 scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of progression and classification ( see table 2 ) . <p> 12.14 The 0-20 point scale is a non-linear ordinal scale ; for example , a mark on the 0-20 point scale IS NOT equivalent to a percentage arrived at by multiplying the mark by 5 . Table 2 provides an equivalence relationship between the scales to enable the aggregation of marks from different assessment events to provide the overall unit mark which will be a percentage . This is illustrated below for a notional unit . <p> In this example the MCQ uses all points on the 0-100 scale whereas all the other assessments use the 0-20 point scale . <p> To achieve the final unit mark each component mark needs to be adjusted as shown below : <p> Dissertation ( 25% ) <p> Unseen written exam ( 35% ) <p> MCQ <p> ( 25% ) <p> Oral exam ( 15% ) <p> Total unit mark out of 100 <p> Actual score <p> 12 on 0-20 scale <p> 8 on 0-20 scale <p> 57 on 0-100 scale <p> 15 on 0-20 scale <p> Adjusted to 0-100 scale <p> 62/100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 62 x 25 = 1550 <p> 48 x 35 = 1680 <p> 57 x 25 = 1425 <p> 72 x 15 = 1080 <p> 5735/100 = 57.35 ( 57 ) <p> 12.15 The overall unit mark must be expressed as a percentage as the Universitys degree classification methodology is based on the percentage scale . <p> 12.16 The final programme or taught component mark will be calculated by applying the agreed algorithm to the unit marks ( see Section 31 and Section 39 ) .

Since primary care practitioners often care for people over extended periods of time , the relationship between patient and doctor is particularly important . Primary health care involves providing treatment for common illnesses , the management of long term illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease and the prevention of future ill-health through advice , immunisation and screening programmes .

@@77496399 @6196399/ <h> Definitions <p> 4.1 The Recognition of Prior Learning ( RPL previously known as APL ) is a process whereby students can be exempt from some parts of their chosen programme of academic study by recognition of their learning from previous experiences or achievements . <p> Recognised Prior ' Certified ' Learning is the achievement of learning that has been formally assessed and certificated from previous study with a higher education organisation . <p> Recognised Prior ' Experiential ' Learning is the non-certified acquisition of relevant skills and knowledge , gained through relevant experience , which is capable of being evaluated . <p> 4.2 Some programmes have approved units/periods of study undertaken at another institution or in the workplace . Where this is a recognised part of an approved programme this policy does not apply . <p> 4.3 The term prior learning does not include the learning implicit in formal teaching , a work placement , group work or independent study designed as part of a programme of study alone . Recognition of such parallel learning would be expected to occur in the formal assessment practice of the programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning , or outcomes of the learning , and not just the experience of the activities that is being accredited . In all cases evidence must be presented to the University that such learning has taken place . <p> 4.5 Evidence for acceptance of RPL should demonstrate that the learner has a reasonable expectation of satisfactorily completing the programme for which they are applying . <p> 4.6 Students may request to view additional criteria , by which it judges applications for RPL . <p> 4.7 All applications for the recognition of prior learning will be considered for approval by the Programme Director and the Faculty Recruitment and Admissions Officer . Prior learning will not normally be accepted if five or more years have elapsed since it occurred unless the applicant can provide evidence that his/her learning has continued in a professional or similar context . In such cases the school may choose to set an assessment to test an applicant 's current knowledge . <p> 4.8 To complement the Universitys credit framework ( see Section 3 ) the following table shows maximum amounts of credit for each type of programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum amount of certified prior learning can be exceeded where a student is returning to undertake a top-up qualification , provided that the lower award has been made by the University and is still relevant to the higher qualification . <p> Prior learning in the undergraduate professional programmes of BDS , MBChB and BVSc may be accepted in lieu of an individual unit , at the discretion of the relevant Programme Director . <p> 4.9 The conferring of one of the awards listed in the table and the recognition of prior learning within this is complemented by the following : <p> a ) Sufficient credit at the highest level of the award , as outlined in the Universitys credit framework , must be taken at the University of Bristol ( or , for a Joint Award , one of its partner institutions ) in order for the award to be conferred . <p> b ) The final 120 credit points of an undergraduate degree programme must be taken and satisfactorily completed at the University of Bristol unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary that has been approved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally accredit prior learning within the final year of its bachelors and integrated masters programmes . <p> c ) The dissertation or research component of a taught postgraduate programme must be taken and satisfactorily completed at the University of Bristol ( or , for a Joint Award , one of its partner institutions ) . <h> Recognising Prior Certified Learning <p> 4.10 Schools should consider the learning which has been accredited and decide , in the best interests of the student , how this can be taken into account . It is at the discretion of the school to decide if : ( a ) the subject content , and therefore knowledge gained , is sufficiently similar for a student to be exempt from unit(s) , and ( b ) if marks can be transferred . <p> If a student wishes to recognise learning obtained from online courses , the school should seek advice from the relevant Faculty Education Director and the Academic Registrar . <p> 4.11 Therefore , prior credit obtained from another institution can be recognised in one of two ways : <p> ( a ) Exemption from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final award and need not be transferred ( University of Bristol accepts the credit awarded by another institution ) ; <p> ( b ) Exemption from units , the marks of which do contribute to the final award and are transferred ( University of Bristol accepts the credit and marks awarded by another institution towards this award ) . <p> 4.12 The requirement to transfer marks may be waived for students transferring into an undergraduate professional programme if there is still a significant proportion ( e.g. 360 or more , out of 600 credit points ) of the programme to complete . <h> Recognising Prior Experiential Learning <p> 4.13 Schools should consider each case and decide from which units the student can be exempt . The school should satisfy itself that the applicant has sufficient knowledge and ability to have a reasonable expectation of completing the programme successfully . <p> 4.14 If a school is not satisfied that the experiential learning is equivalent to the standard of unit(s) , it may require the applicant to undertake an appropriate method of assessment . <p> See Annex 13 on how RPL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or the degree classification in modular undergraduate programmes .

For example , in halls such as Hiatt Baker , additional common rooms , computer rooms , study rooms , a music room , and a bar are provided . All of these additional facilities require cleaning , heating , lighting , maintenance , etc , which results in higher running costs . <p> Rents are banded , wherever possible , to allow students to make comparisons of offerings and to ensure a range of budgets can be met . We ensure there are a number of rooms capped at a lower level budget rent , and this rent level is agreed with the Students Union . <p> All University rents are also benchmarked against rents charged at other institutions and commercial accommodation providers in Bristol .

@@77496429 @6196429/ <h> Abstract <p> Abstract A global selection of 56 mid-ocean ridge basalt ( MORB ) glasses were analysed for Li and B abundances and isotopic compositions . Analytical accuracy and precision of analyses constitute an improvement over previously published MORB data and allow a more detailed discussion of the Li and B systematics of the crust-mantle system . Refined estimates for primitive mantle abundances ( Li = 1.39 0.10 g/g and B = 0.19 0.02 g/g ) and depleted mantle abundances ( Li = 1.20 0.10 g/g and B = 0.077 0.010 g/g ) are presented based on mass balance and on partial melting models that utilise observed element ratios in MORB . Assimilation of seawater ( or brine ) or seawater-altered material beneath the ridge , identified by high Cl / K , causes significant elevation of MORB d 11 B and variable elevation in d 7 Li . The B isotope ratio is , hence , identified as a reliable indicator of assimilation in MORB and values higher than -6 are strongly indicative of shallow contamination of the magma . The global set of samples investigated here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depleted and enriched MORB from slow and fast-spreading ridge segments with a range of radiogenic isotope signatures and trace element compositions . Uncontaminated ( low- Cl / K ) MORB show no significant boron isotope variation at the current level of analytical precision , and hence a homogenous B isotopic composition of d 11 B = - 7.1 0.9 ( mean of six ridge segments ; 2SD ) . Boron isotope fractionation during mantle melting and basalt fractionation likely is small , and this d 11 B value reflects the B isotopic composition of the depleted mantle and the bulk silicate Earth , probably within 0.4 . Our sample set shows a mean d 7 Li = + 3.5 1.0 ( mean of five ridge segments ; 2SD ) , excluding high- Cl / K samples . A significant variation of 1.0-1.5 exists among various ridge segments and among samples within individual ridge segments , but this variation is unrelated to differentiation , assimilation or mantle source indicators , such as radiogenic isotopes or trace elements . It , therefore , seems likely that kinetic fractionation of Li isotopes during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li excursions in MORB . No mantle heterogeneities , such as those generated by deeply recycled subducted materials , are invoked in the interpretation of the Li and B isotope data presented here , in contrast to previous work on smaller data sets . Lithium and boron budgets for the silicate Earth are presented that are based on isotope and element mass balance . A refined estimate for the B isotopic composition of the bulk continental crust is given as d 11 B = - 9.1 2.4 . Mass balance allows the existence of recycled B reservoirs in the deep mantle , but these are not required . However , mass balance among the crust , sediments and seawater shows enrichment of 6 Li in the surface reservoirs , which requires the existence of 7 Li -enriched material in the mantle . This may have formed by the subduction of altered oceanic crust since the Archaean.

In general , our experience is that essays which are good in content are also good in construction and expression ; if not , guidance will be given on the areas of weakness . <p> In the case of work presented in a foreign language it is of course commoner for the marker to detect a significant difference between content and expression : excellent material in an essay on a social or literary topic will be brought down by linguistic mistakes , and a flawless essay will not gain a top mark if it is derivative , irrelevant or dull .

@@77496447 @6196447/ <h> Abstract <p> A video-ethnographic study of a practicing taxidermist opens up new spaces of enquiry into the more-than-human geographies of craft and craftwork . In an attempt to witness the non-representational and more-than-human aspects of taxidermy craftwork I undertook a video ethnography of taxidermist Peter Summers based at the National Museum Scotland ( NMS ) . Using a discreet HD video camera I filmed Peter performing various aspects of the craft during a number of workshop visits that took place over a three-year period . The resulting archive of video footage offers a portfolio of ethnographic exposures ( Dewsbury 2009 : 326 ) , enabling enquiry into the craft techniques it takes to separate a skin from a body and rearrange it in life-like form again . In this chapter I aim to elaborate on , and present aspects of , this video-ethnography in order to emphasise its potential for witnessing and exposing the sensory , affective and more-than-human registers of taxidermy practice . Overall the chapter aims to highlight video-ethnography as an effective and affective tool for studying craft practices , emphasising the serious empirical involvements required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materialities of craftwork .

Introduction <p> The University of Bristol is a caring employer and provides considerable support to all staff in times of sickness and personal difficulties . The aim of this document is to provide managers with guidelines on how to deal with individual employees , from all categories of staff , who are absent due to sickness . <p> It is important that a consistent approach is adopted and a balance struck between providing support to the employee , recognising individual circumstances whilst ultimately securing their return to work and improving attendance generally . <p> It is imperative that confidentiality with regard to an individuals health and personal circumstances is maintained at all times . <p> Awareness of health and safety issues must be borne in mind and a risk assessment must be carried out in the light of any injury at work . <p> Whilst recognising the wish to be reasonable and sensitive in cases of sickness absence , the University is very conscious of the fact that poor attendance at work can contribute to reduced efficiency and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Sickness Reporting Procedure <p> a ) Individual Departments should establish an agreed procedure for reporting absence and should specify an individual to contact and also identify an alternative . It is essential that all staff are made aware of the operation of this procedure . Staff who are taken i 'll at work should be sent or taken home and this day will not count against their sickness entitlement . <p> On the first day of absence , staff ( or someone on their behalf ) are required to notify the identified individual as early as possible ( normally by 10.00 a.m . ) . Specific arrangements may need to be made for an employee who may live alone and/or does not have access to a telephone . <p> b ) Individuals who report their absence must provide : - <p> i ) information regarding the reason for their absence , " sick " or " unwell " is not an acceptable explanation for absence from work e.g. back pain , flu symptoms etc ; ii ) whether or not they intend to visit a doctor ; iii ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to call again with further information . <p> c ) On return to work all staff must complete a self-certification form , irrespective of the number of days taken , and this form should be returned to the Salaries Section in the Finance Office . <p> d ) A nominated member of the Department will be responsible for keeping full sickness records and issuing a weekly return to the Salaries Office . <p> e ) Employees who are absent for 8 days ( including Saturdays and Sundays ) or more must provide a doctors certificate ( a " fit note " see ( 3 ) below ) . <p> Please note that the University has a right to request a private Medical Certificate ( if there are particular concerns regarding an individuals absence ) , but this should be discussed with your Human Resources Manager and not enforced as a matter of routine . <p> Any referral to an individuals G.P. or to Occupational Health must be achieved via Human Resources . <p> f ) Staff who are employed as food handlers and have been absent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twenty-four hours MUST NOT return to work until they have been formally cleared to do so by their G.P. Further details are given in the Universitys Food Safety Policy and Codes of Practice folder . <h> 3 . Fit Notes <p> Fit notes ( formerly known as sick notes ) are the forms that are issued by G.P.s to people as evidence for their employer that the employee is i 'll or injured and unable to attend work as normal . <p> Under the fit note system , a G.P may advise that the employee is either : <p> Unfit for work <p> This confirms that the employee is too i 'll to work at all for the stated period of time . <p> or <p> May be fit for work taking account of the following advice <p> This confirms that the employees health condition may allow them to work with suitable support if available . The G.P will then indicate on the form which kind of support the employee may benefit from ( e.g. amended duties , workplace adaptations , a phased return to work or altered hours ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the case . If an employer is unable to facilitate a change or adjustment , the fit note will count as evidence that the employee has a health condition preventing them from carrying out their role and should therefore remain on sick leave for the stated period of time . <p> On receipt of a fit note indicating that an employee may be fit for work taking into account certain support , managers should contact their Faculty HR Manager for advice . A decision will then be made jointly by the manager and HR Manager , following discussion with the employee as appropriate , regarding whether or not it is possible to accommodate the recommended advice . Where the HR Manager judges that it is appropriate , further advice may also be sought from the Occupational Health Service before a decision is reached . Until a decision has been reached , the employee should remain on sick leave . <p> The University is keen to support staff in a return to work wherever possible and will consider all recommendations carefully before a decision is reached , taking full account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where appropriate . <h> 4 . Recording and Monitoring <p> To ensure that this guidance for managing absence is applied effectively , it is essential that sound monitoring procedures exist in all Departments . Records for all employees should be kept and include the number of days absent , the reason for the absence , together with a cumulative total over a rolling 12 month period . <p> Individual managers must determine in terms of duration and incidence , when an employees absence/s needs to be investigated further . Whilst it is important to adopt a consistent approach , each case must be considered individually , depending on the circumstances , before any action is taken . <p> As a rule of thumb 10 uncertificated days absence in the last 12 months or more than one months certificated absence may need to be investigated , in particular to determine whether this may be due to a disability . Advice can be obtained from your HR Manager regarding appropriate action in individual cases or where there are general concerns regarding absence . <h> 5 . Sickness Pay <p> All staff are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend work due to illness . For details of the sick pay entitlements , please see the appropriate terms and conditions . <h> 6 . The Return Interview <p> Following each absence from work due to sickness , the employee should be seen by his/her supervisor/manager . This is an essential part of absence management and can be as informal or as formal as the circumstances dictate . It is important that proper preparation is made and that the interview is conducted fairly and consistently and always includes : - <p> Welcome Back - It is always appropriate to welcome an employee back to work following any period of absence . This will give the supervisor/manager a more formal opportunity to tell individuals that they were missed and that the University values their work and their contribution to the Department . <p> Enquire About Health - the line manager or supervisor has a duty of care to ensure that employees are fit to work and should gently explore the reason for absence and whether the absence is work related . ( It should be recognised that sickness absence can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , harassment , personal difficulties etc . ) . Identify what steps the individual has taken to investigate the cause and if necessary , what preventative measures he/she is taking to ensure that it does not re-occur . <p> It is particularly important to show care and concern during this exploratory stage of the interview and assurance should be provided as necessary . <p> Consequences and Observations - If there are concerns regarding an individuals attendance record it may be appropriate to bring to the individuals attention the facts regarding his/her attendance in the last 6 or 12 months , including any apparent patterns of absence . <p> If there is sufficient cause for concern it may be necessary to explore the possibility of obtaining medical evidence , via the Faculty/Divisions Human Resources team , in order to establish an individuals well being and capability . If following the necessary investigation , abuse of the sickness scheme is suspected , the employee must be advised that further absence may lead to action being taken under the Conduct Procedure and/or suspension of the sick pay entitlements . <p> The appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can help the employee to improve their attendance . <h> 7 . Long Term Sickness <p> Regular contact should be maintained with an employee during prolonged periods of sickness absence . <p> Action taken will vary depending on the reason for the absence , but the manager , together with the HR Manager , will normally visit the employee following 6 weeks of absence or as appropriate . It is necessary to establish whether the employee needs any assistance and to keep him/her feeling part of the team . <p> It may be necessary to refer the individual to the Universitys Occupational Health Service and/or request a written report from the individuals General Practitioner , in order to obtain further information regarding the impact on their state of health and prospects for return to work . This will be arranged via the Faculty/Divisions Human Resources team . Once this report has been received a decision will need to be made regarding possible future courses of action .

@@77496470 @6196470/ <p> Of Interest by David Hume Nothing is esteemed a more certain sign of the flourishing condition of any nation than the lowness of interest : And with reason ; though I believe the cause is somewhat different from what is commonly apprehended . Lowness of interest is generally ascribed to plenty of money . But money , however plentiful , has no other effect , if fixed , than to raise the price of labour . Silver is more common than gold ; and therefore you receive a greater quantity of it for the same commodities . But do you pay less interest for it ? Interest in BATAVIA and JAMAICA is at 10 per cent . in PORTUGAL at 6 ; though these places , as we may learn from the prices of every thing , abound more in gold and silver than either LONDON or AMSTERDAM . Were all the gold in ENGLAND annihilated at once , and one and twenty shillings substituted in the place of every guinea , would money be more plentiful or interest lower ? No surely : We should only use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as silver , and silver as common as copper ; would money be more plentiful or interest lower ? We may assuredly give the same answer . Our shillings would then be yellow , and our halfpence white ; and we should have no guineas . No other difference would ever be observed ; no alteration on commerce , manufactures , navigation , or interest ; unless we imagine , that the colour of the metal is of any consequence . Now , what is so visible in these greater variations of scarcity or abundance in the precious metals , must hold in all inferior changes . If the multiplying of gold and silver fifteen times makes no difference , much less can the doubling or tripling them . All augmentation has no other effect than to heighten the price of labour and commodities ; and even this variation is little more than that of a name . In the progress towards these changes , the augmentation may have some influence , by exciting industry ; but after the prices are settled , suitably to the new abundance of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An effect always holds proportion with its cause . Prices have risen near four times since the discovery of the INDIES ; and it is probable gold and silver have multiplied much more : But interest has not fallen much above half . The rate of interest , therefore , is not derived from the quantity of the precious metals . Money having chiefly a fictitious value , the greater or less plenty of it is of no consequence , if we consider a nation within itself ; and the quantity of specie , when once fixed , though ever so large , has no other effect , than to oblige every one to tell out a greater number of those shining bits of metal , for clothes , furniture or equipage , without encreasing any one convenience of life . If a man borrow money to build a house , he then carries home a greater load ; because the stone , timber , lead , glass , &amp;c. with the labour of the masons and carpenters , are represented by a greater quantity of gold and silver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can no alteration arise , from their bulk or quantity , their weight or colour , either upon their real value or their interest . The same interest , in all cases , bears the same proportion to the sum . And if you lent me so much labour and so many commodities ; by receiving five per cent . you always receive proportional labour and commodities , however represented , whether by yellow or white coin , whether by a pound or an ounce . It is in vain , therefore , to look for the cause of the fall or rise of interest in the greater or less quantity of gold and silver , which is fixed in any nation . High interest arises from three circumstances : A great demand for borrowing ; little riches to supply that demand ; and great profits arising from commerce : And these circumstances are a clear proof of the small advance of commerce and industry , not of the scarcity of gold and silver . Low interest , on the other hand , proceeds from the three opposite circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply that demand ; and small profits arising from commerce : And these circumstances are all connected together , and proceed from the encrease of industry and commerce , not of gold and silver . We shall endeavour to prove these points ; and shall begin with the causes and the effects of a great or small demand for borrowing . When a people have emerged ever so little from a savage state , and their numbers have encreased beyond the original multitude , there must immediately arise an inequality of property ; and while some possess large tracts of land , others are confined within narrow limits , and some are entirely without any landed property . Those who possess more land than they can labour , employ those who possess none , and agree to receive a determinate part of the product . Thus the landed interest is immediately established ; nor is there any settled government , however rude , in which affairs are not on this footing . Of these proprietors of land , some must presently discover themselves to be of different tempers from others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his land for futurity , another desires to consume at present what should suffice for many years . But as the spending of a settled revenue is a way of life entirely without occupation ; men have so much need of somewhat to fix and engage them , that pleasures , such as they are , will be the pursuit of the greater part of the landholders , and the prodigals among them will always be more numerous than the misers . In a state , therefore , where there is nothing but a landed interest , as there is little frugality , the borrowers must be very numerous , and the rate of interest must hold proportion to it . The difference depends not on the quantity of money , but on the habits and manners which prevail . By this alone the demand for borrowing is encreased or diminished . Were money so plentiful as to make an egg be sold for sixpence ; so long as there are only landed gentry and peasants in the state , the borrowers must be numerous , and interest high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more bulky : But the same idleness of the landlord , with the higher price of commodities , would dissipate it in the same time , and produce the same necessity and demand for borrowing . Nor is the case different with regard to the second circumstance which we proposed to consider , namely , the great or little riches to supply the demand . This effect also depends on the habits and way of living of the people , not on the quantity of gold and silver . In order to have , in any state , a great number of lenders , it is not sufficient nor requisite , that there be great abundance of the precious metals . It is only requisite , that the property or command of that quantity , which is in the state , whether great or small , should be collected in particular hands , so as to form considerable sums , or compose a great monied interest . This begets a number of lenders , and sinks the rate of usury ; and this I shall venture to affirm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular manners and customs , which make the specie gather into separate sums or masses of considerable value . For suppose , that , by miracle , every man in GREAT BRITAIN should have five pounds slipt into his pocket in one night ; this would much more than double the whole money that is at present in the kingdom ; yet there would not next day , nor for some time , be any more lenders , nor any variation in the interest . And were there nothing but landlords and peasants in the state , this money , however abundant , could never gather into sums ; and would only serve to encrease the prices of every thing , without any farther consequence . The prodigal landlord dissipates it , as fast as he receives it ; and the beggarly peasant has no means , nor view , nor ambition of obtaining above a bare livelihood . The overplus of borrowers above that of lenders continuing still the same , there will follow no reduction of interest . That depends upon another principle ; and must proceed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce . Every thing useful to the life of man arises from the ground ; but few things arise in that condition which is requisite to render them useful . There must , therefore , beside the peasants and the proprietors of land , be another rank of men , who receiving from the former the rude materials , work them into their proper form , and retain part for their own use and subsistence . In the infancy of society , these contracts between the artisans and the peasants , and between one species of artisans and another are commonly entered into immediately by the persons themselves , who , being neighbours , are easily acquainted with each other 's necessities , and can lend their mutual assistance to supply them . But when men 's industry encreases , and their views enlarge , it is found , that the most remote parts of the state can assist each other as well as the more contiguous , and that this intercourse of good offices may be carried on to the greatest extent and intricacy . Hence the origin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who serve as agents between those parts of the state , that are wholly unacquainted , and are ignorant of each other 's necessities . Here are in a city fifty workmen in silk and linen , and a thousand customers ; and these two ranks of men , so necessary to each other , can never rightly meet , till one man erects a shop , to which all the workmen and all the customers repair . In this province , grass rises in abundance : The inhabitants abound in cheese , and butter , and cattle ; but want bread and corn , which , in a neighbouring province , are in too great abundance for the use of the inhabitants . One man discovers this . He brings corn from the one province and returns with cattle ; and supplying the wants of both , he is , so far , a common benefactor . As the people encrease in numbers and industry , the difficulty of their intercourse encreases : The business of the agency or merchandize becomes more intricate ; and divides , subdivides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all these transactions , it is necessary , and reasonable , that a considerable part of the commodities and labour should belong to the merchant , to whom , in a great measure , they are owing . And these commodities he will sometimes preserve in kind , or more commonly convert into money , which is their common representation . If gold and silver have encreased in the state together with the industry , it will require a great quantity of these metals to represent a great quantity of commodities and labour . If industry alone has encreased , the prices of every thing must sink , and a small quantity of specie will serve as a representation . There is no craving or demand of the human mind more constant and insatiable than that for exercise and employment ; and this desire seems the foundation of most of our passions and pursuits . Deprive a man of all business and serious occupation , he runs restless from one amusement to another ; and the weight and oppression , which he feels from idleness , is so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his immoderate expences . Give him a more harmless way of employing his mind or body , he is satisfied , and feels no longer that insatiable thirst after pleasure . But if the employment you give him be lucrative , especially if the profit be attached to every particular exertion of industry , he has gain so often in his eye , that he acquires , by degrees , a passion for it , and knows no such pleasure as that of seeing the daily encrease of his fortune . And this is the reason why trade encreases frugality , and why , among merchants , there is the same overplus of misers above prodigals , as , among the possessors of land , there is the contrary . Commerce encreases industry , by conveying it readily from one member of the state to another , and allowing none of it to perish or become useless . It encreases frugality , by giving occupation to men , and employing them in the arts of gain , which soon engage their affection , and remove all relish for pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrious professions , to beget frugality , and make the love of gain prevail over the love of pleasure . Among lawyers and physicians who have any practice , there are many more who live within their income , than who exceed it , or even live up to it . But lawyers and physicians beget no industry ; and it is even at the expence of others they acquire their riches ; so that they are sure to diminish the possessions of some of their fellow- citizens , as fast as they encrease their own . Merchants , on the contrary , beget industry , by serving as canals to convey it through every corner of the state : And at the same time , by their frugality , they acquire great power over that industry , and collect a large property in the labour and commodities , which they are the chief instruments in producing . There is no other profession , therefore , except merchandize , which can make the monied interest considerable , or , in other words , can encrease industry , and , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry to particular members of the society . Without commerce , the state must consist chiefly of landed gentry , whose prodigality and expence make a continual demand for borrowing ; and of peasants , who have no sums to supply that demand . The money never gathers into large stocks or sums , which can be lent at interest . It is dispersed into numberless hands , who either squander it in idle show and magnificence , or employ it in the purchase of the common necessaries of life . Commerce alone assembles it into considerable sums ; and this effect it has merely from the industry which it begets , and the frugality which it inspires , independent of that particular quantity of precious metal which may circulate in the state . Thus an encrease of commerce , by a necessary consequence , raises a great number of lenders , and by that means produces lowness of interest . We must now consider how far this encrease of commerce diminishes the profits arising from that profession , and gives rise to the third circumstance requisite to produce lowness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this head , that low interest and low profits of merchandize are two events , that mutually forward each other , and are both originally derived from that extensive commerce , which produces opulent merchants , and renders the monied interest considerable . Where merchants possess great stocks , whether represented by few or many pieces of metal , it must frequently happen , that , when they either become tired of business , or leave heirs unwilling or unfit to engage in commerce , a great proportion of these riches naturally seeks an annual and secure revenue . The plenty diminishes the price , and makes the lenders accept of a low interest . This consideration obliges many to keep their stock employed in trade , and rather be content with low profits than dispose of their money at an under-value . On the other hand , when commerce has become extensive , and employs large stocks , there must arise rivalships among the merchants , which diminish the profits of trade , at the same time that they encrease the trade itself . The low profits of merchandize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , when they leave off business , and begin to indulge themselves in ease and indolence . It is needless , therefore , to enquire which of these circumstances , to wit , low interest or low profits , is the cause , and which the effect ? They both arise from an extensive commerce , and mutually forward each other . No man will accept of low profits , where he can have high interest ; and no man will accept of low interest , where he can have high profits . An extensive commerce , by producing large stocks , diminishes both interest and profits ; and is always assisted , in its diminution of the one , by the proportional sinking of the other . I may add , that , as low profits arise from the encrease of commerce and industry , they serve in their turn to its farther encrease , by rendering the commodities cheaper , encouraging the consumption , and heightening the industry . And thus , if we consider the whole connexion of causes and effects , interest is the barometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost infallible of the flourishing condition of a people . It proves the encrease of industry , and its prompt circulation through the whole state , little inferior to a demonstration . And though , perhaps , it may not be impossible but a sudden and a great check to commerce may have a momentary effect of the same kind , by throwing so many stocks out of trade ; it must be attended with such misery and want of employment in the poor , that , besides its short duration , it will not be possible to mistake the one case for the other . Those who have asserted , that the plenty of money was the cause of low interest , seem to have taken a collateral effect for a cause ; since the same industry , which sinks the interest , commonly acquires great abundance of the precious metals . A variety of fine manufactures , with vigilant enterprising merchants , will soon draw money to a state , if it be any where to be found in the world . The same cause , by multiplying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great riches into the hands of persons , who are not proprietors of land , and produces , by that means , a lowness of interest . But though both these effects , plenty of money and low interest , naturally arise from commerce and industry , they are altogether independent of each other . For suppose a nation removed into the Pacific ocean , without any foreign commerce , or any knowledge of navigation : Suppose , that this nation possesses always the same stock of coin , but is continually encreasing in its numbers and industry : It is evident , that the price of every commodity must gradually diminish in that kingdom ; since it is the proportion between money and any species of goods , which fixes their mutual value ; and , upon the present supposition , the conveniencies of life become every day more abundant , without any alteration in the current specie . A less quantity of money , therefore , among this people , will make a rich man , during the times of industry , than would suffice to that purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a house , portion a daughter , buy an estate , support a manufactory , or maintain a family and equipage . These are the uses for which men borrow money ; and therefore , the greater or less quantity of it in a state has no influence on the interest . But it is evident , that the greater or less stock of labour and commodities must have a great influence ; since we really and in effect borrow these , when we take money upon interest . It is true , when commerce is extended all over the globe , the most industrious nations always abound most with the precious metals : So that low interest and plenty of money are in fact almost inseparable . But still it is of consequence to know the principle whence any phenomenon arises , and to distinguish between a cause and a concomitant effect . Besides that the speculation is curious , it may frequently be of use in the conduct of public affairs . At least , it must be owned , that nothing can be of more use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning on these subjects , which of all others are the most important ; though they are commonly treated in the loosest and most careless manner . Another reason of this popular mistake with regard to the cause of low interest , seems to be the instance of some nations ; where , after a sudden acquisition of money or of the precious metals , by means of foreign conquest , the interest has fallen , not only among them , but in all the neighbouring states , as soon as that money was dispersed , and had insinuated itself into every corner . Thus , interest in SPAIN fell near a half immediately after the discovery of the WEST INDIES , as we are informed by GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA : And it has been ever since gradually sinking in every kingdom of EUROPE . Interest in ROME , after the conquest of EGYPT , fell from 6 to 4 per cent . as we learn from DION . The causes of the sinking of interest , upon such an event , seem different in the conquering country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we justly ascribe that effect merely to the encrease of gold and silver . In the conquering country , it is natural to imagine , that this new acquisition of money will fall into a few hands , and be gathered into large sums , which seek a secure revenue , either by the purchase of land or by interest ; and consequently the same effect follows , for a little time , as if there had been a great accession of industry and commerce . The encrease of lenders above the borrowers sinks the interest ; and so much the faster , if those , who have acquired those large sums , find no industry or commerce in the state , and no method of employing their money but by lending it at interest . But after this new mass of gold and silver has been digested , and has circulated through the whole state , affairs will soon return to their former situation ; while the landlords and new money-holders , living idly , squander above their income ; and the former daily contract debt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole money may still be in the state , and make itself felt by the encrease of prices : But not being now collected into any large masses or stocks , the disproportion between the borrowers and lenders is the same as formerly , and consequently the high interest returns . Accordingly we find , in ROME , that , so early as TIBERIUS 'S time , interest had again mounted to 6 per cent . though no accident had happened to drain the empire of money . In TRAJAN 'S time , money lent on mortgages in ITALY , bore 6 per cent . on common securities in BITHYNIA , 12 . And if interest in SPAIN has not risen to its old pitch ; this can be ascribed to nothing but the continuance of the same cause that sunk it , to wit , the large fortunes continually made in the INDIES , which come over to SPAIN from time to time , and supply the demand of the borrowers . By this accidental and extraneous cause , more money is to be lent in SPAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums than would otherwise be found in a state , where there are so little commerce and industry . As to the reduction of interest , which has followed in ENGLAND , FRANCE , and other kingdoms of EUROPE , that have no mines , it has been gradual ; and has not proceeded from the encrease of money , considered merely in itself ; but from that of industry , which is the natural effect of the former encrease , in that interval , before it raises the price of labour and provisions . For to return to the foregoing supposition ; if the industry of ENGLAND had risen as much from other causes , ( and that rise might easily have happened , though the stock of money had remained the same ) must not all the same consequences have followed , which we observe at present ?

We focus on the political and ideological dimensions of this process , paying particular attention to the way the narrow character of associated debates is produced and maintained .

The body of work that stresses the agency and rights of migrant women in the sex sector has put forward a convincing critique of the passive and enslaved trafficking victim and has replaced the latter with the figures of the active migrant and the political protagonist . Despite such a shift , however , the figure of the trafficking victim continues to dominate public and policy arenas . In this chapter , I am interested in the persistence of the figure of the victim and suggest that that the figure of the victim is not a free-floating but rather produced through specific codes and conventions .

This method promises to empower scholars with a quantitative and data-driven tool to study culture and society , but its power has been limited by the use of data from books and simple analytics based essentially on word counts . This study addresses these problems by assembling a vast corpus of regional newspapers from the United Kingdom , incorporating very fine-grained geographical and temporal information that is not available for books . The corpus spans 150 years and is formed by millions of articles , representing 14% of all British regional outlets of the period . Simple content analysis of this corpus allowed us to detect specific events , like wars , epidemics , coronations , or conclaves , with high accuracy , whereas the use of more refined techniques from artificial intelligence enabled us to move beyond counting words by detecting references to named entities . These techniques allowed us to observe both a systematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the 20th century and the change of geographic focus for various concepts .

On the Discouragements opposed by the above Restraints to the Progress of Inventive Industry 1787 LETTER I.

From so general and universal a neglect , it is an old notion of mine , as you well know , that this meek and unassuming species of liberty has been suffering much injustice . A fancy has taken me , just now , to trouble you with my reasons : which , if you think them capable of answering any good purpose , you may forward to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you less trouble , to the fire . In a word , the proposition I have been accustomed to lay down to myself on this subject is the following one , viz. that no man of ripe years and of sound mind , acting freely , and with his eyes open , ought to be hindered , with a view to his advantage , from making such bargain , in the way of obtaining money , as he thinks fit : nor , ( what is a necessary consequence ) any body hindered from supplying him , upon any terms he thinks proper to accede to . This proposition , were it to be received , would level , you see , at one stroke , all the barriers which law , either statute or common , have in their united wisdom set up , either against the crying sin of Usury , or against the hard-named and little-heard-of practice of Champerty ; to which we must also add a portion of the multifarious , and as little heard-of offence , of Maintenance .

In favour of the restraints opposed to the species of liberty I contend for , I can imagine but five arguments . 1 . Prevention of usury . 2 . Prevention of prodigality. 3 . Protection of indigence against extortion . 4 . Repression of the temerity of projectors. 5 . Protection of simplicity against imposition . Of all these in their order . LETTER II Reasons for Restraint . -- Prevention of Usury . I will begin with the prevention of usury : because in the sound of the word usury lies , I take it , the main strength of the argument : or , to speak strictly , of what is of more importance than all argument , of the hold which the opinion I am combating has obtained on the imaginations and passions of mankind . Usury is a bad thing , and as such ought to be prevented : usurers are a bad sort of men , a very bad sort of men , and as such ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string of propositions which every man finds handed down to him from his progenitors : which most men are disposed to accede to without examination , and indeed not unnaturally nor even unreasonably disposed , for it is impossible the bulk of mankind should find leisure , had they the ability , to examine into the grounds of an hundredth part of the rules and maxims , which they find themselves obliged to act upon . Very good apology this for John Trot : but a little more inquisitiveness may be required of legislators . You , my friend , by whom the true force of words is so well understood , have , I am sure , gone before me in perceiving , that to say usury is a thing to be prevented , is neither more nor less than begging the matter in question . I know of but two definitions that can possibly be given of usury : one is , the taking of a greater interest than the law allows of : this may be stiled the political or legal definition . The other is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to give and take : this may be stiled the moral one : and this , where the law has not interfered , is plainly enough the only one . It is plain , that in order for usury to be prohibited by law , a positive description must have been found for it by law , fixing , or rather superseding , the moral one . To say then that usury is a thing that ought to be prevented , is saying neither more nor less , than that the utmost rate of interest which shall be taken ought to be fixed ; and that fixation enforced by penalties , or such other means , if any , as may answer the purpose of preventing the breach of it . A law punishing usury supposes , therefore , a law fixing the allowed legal rate of interest : and the propriety of the penal law must depend upon the propriety of the simply-prohibitive , or , if you please , declaratory one . One thing then is plain ; that , antecedently to custom growing from convention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what rate of interest is there that can naturally be more proper than another ? what natural fixed price can there be for the use of money more than for the use of any other thing ? Were it not then for custom , usury , considered in a moral view , would not then so much as admit of a definition : so far from having existence , it would not so much as be conceivable : nor therefore could the law , in the definition it took upon itself to give of such offence , have so much as a guide to steer by . Custom therefore is the sole basis , which , either the moralist in his rules and precepts , or the legislator in his injunctions , can have to build upon . But what basis can be more weak or unwarrantable , as a ground for coercive measures , than custom resulting from free choice ? My neighbours , being at liberty , have happened to concur among themselves in dealing at a certain rate of interest . I , who have money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me , would be glad , the one of us to accept , the other to give , an interest somewhat higher than theirs : why is the liberty they exercise to be made a pretence for depriving me and Titius of ours ? Nor has blind custom , thus made the sole and arbitrary guide , any thing of steadiness or uniformity in its decisions : it has varied , from age to age , in the same country : it varies , from country to country , in the same age : and the legal rate has varied along with it : and indeed , with regard to times past , it is from the legal rate , more readily than from any other source , that we collect the customary . Among the Romans , till the time of Justinian , we find it as high as 12 per cent : in England , so late as the time of Hen . VIII , we find it at 10 per cent : succeeding statutes reduced it to 8 , then to 6 , and lastly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present in Ireland it is at 6 per cent ; and in the West-Indies at 8 per cent ; and in Hindostan , where there is no rate limited by law , the lowest customary rate is 10 or 12 . At Constantinople , in certain cases , as I have been well informed , thirty per cent is a common rate . Now , of all these widely different rates , what one is there , that is intrinsically more proper than another ? What is it that evidences this propriety in each instance ? what but the mutual convenience of the parties , as manifested by their consent ? It is convenience then that has produced whatever there has been of custom in the matter : What can there then be in custom , to make it a better guide than the convenience which gave it birth ? and what is there in convenience , that should make it a worse guide in one case than in another ? It would be convenient to me to give 6 per cent for money : I wish to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you shan't. " - Why so ? " Because it is not convenient to your neighbour to give above 5 for it . " Can any thing be more absurd than such a reason ? Much has not been done , I think , by legislators as yet in the way of fixing the price of other commodities : and , in what little has been done , the probity of the intention has , I believe , in general , been rather more unquestionable than the rectitude of the principle , or the felicity of the result . Putting money out at interest , is exchanging present money for future : but why a policy , which , as applied to exchanges in general , would be generally deemed absurd and mischievous , should be deemed necessary in the instance of this particular kind of exchange , mankind are as yet to learn . For him who takes as much as he can get for the use of any other sort of thing , an house for instance , there is no particular appellation , nor any mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor is it usual so much as to profess to do otherwise . Why a man who takes as much as he can get , be it six , or seven , or eight , or ten per cent for the use of a sum of money should be called usurer , should be loaded with an opprobrious name , any more than if he had bought an house with it , and made a proportionable profit by the house , is more than I can see . Another thing I would also wish to learn , is , why the legislator should be more anxious to limit the rate of interest one way , than the other ? why he should set his face against the owners of that species of property more than of any other ? why he should make it his business to prevent their getting more than a certain price for the use of it , rather than to prevent their getting less ? why , in short , he should not take means for making it penal to offer less , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? let any one that can , find an answer to these questions ; it is more than I can do : I except always the distant and imperceptible advantage , of sinking the price of goods of all kinds ; and , in that remote way , multiplying the future enjoyments of individuals . But this was a consideration by far too distant and refined , to have been the original ground for confining the limitation to this side . LETTER III . Reasons for Restraint . -- Prevention of Prodigality . Having done with sounds , I come gladly to propositions ; which , as far as they are true in point of fact , may deserve the name of reasons . And first , as to the efficacy of such restrictive laws with regard to the prevention of Prodigality . That prodigality is a bad thing , and that the prevention of it is a proper object for the legislator to propose to himself , so long as he confines himself to , what I look upon as , proper measures , I have no objection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; though , were this the principal question , I should look upon it as incumbent on me to place in a fair light the reasons there may be for doubting , how far , with regard to a person arrived at the age of discretion , third persons may be competent judges , which of two pains may be of greater force and value to him , the present pain of restraining his present desires , or the future contingent pain he may be exposed to suffer from the want to which the expence of gratifying these desires may hereafter have reduced him . To prevent our doing mischief to one another , it is but too necessary to put bridles into all our mouths : it is necessary to the tranquillity and very being of society : but that the tacking of leading-strings upon the backs of grown persons , in order to prevent their doing themselves a mischief , is not necessary either to the being or tranquillity of society , however conducive to its well-being , I think can not be disputed . Such paternal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a good work , but it certainly is but a work of supererogation . For my own part , I must confess , that so long as such methods only are employed , as to me appear proper ones , and such there are , I should not feel myself disinclined to see some measures taken for the restraining of prodigality : but this I can not look upon as being of the number . My reasons I will now endeavour to lay before you . In the first place , I take it , that it is neither natural nor usual for prodigals , as such , to betake themselves to this method , I mean , that of giving a rate of interest above the ordinary one , to supply their wants . In the first place , no man , I hope you will allow . prodigal or not prodigal , ever thinks of borrowing money to spend , so long as he has ready money of his own , or effects which he can turn into ready money without loss . And this deduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon as the greatest proportion of the persons subject , at any given time , to the imputation of prodigality . In the next place , no man , in such a country as Great Britain at least , has occasion , nor is at all likely , to take up money at an extraordinary rate of interest , who has security to give , equal to that upon which money is commonly to be had at the highest ordinary rate . While so many advertise , as are to be seen every day advertising , money to be lent at five per cent what should possess a man , who has any thing to offer that can be called a security , to give , for example , six per cent is more than I can conceive . You may say , perhaps , that a man who wishes to lend his money out upon security , wishes to have his interest punctually , and that without the expence , and hazard , and trouble , and odium of going to law ; and that , on this account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with than a prodigal . So far I allow you ; but were you to add , that on this account it would be necessary for a prodigal to offer more than another man , there I should disagree with you . In the first place , it is not so easy a thing , nor , I take it , a common thing , for the lender upon security to be able to judge , or even to form any attempt to judge , whether the conduct of one who offers to borrow his money is or is not of such a cast , as to bring him under this description . The question , prodigal or not prodigal , depends upon two pieces of information ; neither of which , in general , is very easy to come at : on the one hand , the amount of his means and reasonable expectations ; on the other band , the amount of his expenditure . The goodness or badness of the security is a question of a very different nature : upon this head , every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information , which is the most satisfactory the nature of things affords , by going to his lawyer . It is accordingly , I take it , on their lawyers opinion , that lenders in general found their determination in these cases , and not upon any calculations they may have formed , concerning the receipt and expenditure of the borrower . But even supposing a man 's disposition to prodigality to be ever so well known , there are always enough to be found , to whom such a disposition would be rather an inducement than an objection , so long as they were satisfied with the security . Every body knows the advantage to be made in case of mortgage , by foreclosing or forcing a sale : and that this advantage it not uncommonly looked out for , will , I believe , hardly be doubted by any one , who has had any occasion to observe the course of business in the court of Chancery . In short , so long as a prodigal has any thing to pledge , or to dispose of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain or even of a contingent nature , I see not , how he can receive the smallest benefit , from any laws that are , or can be made to fix the rate of interest . For , suppose the law to be efficacious as far as it goes , and that the prodigal can find none of those monsters called usurers to deal with him , does he lie quiet ? No such thing : he goes on and gets the money he wants , by selling his interest instead of borrowing . He goes on , I say : for if he has prudence enough to stop him any where , he is not that sort of man , whom it can be worth while for the law to attempt stopping by such means . It is plain enough then , that to a prodigal thus circumstanced , the law can not be of any service ; on the contrary , it may , and in many cases must , be of disservice to him , by denying him the option of a resource , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved more so , but would naturally have proved less so , than those which it leaves still open to him . But of this hereafter . I now come to the only remaining class of prodigals , viz. those who have nothing that can be called a security to offer . These , I should think , are not more likely to get money upon an extraordinary rate of interest , than an ordinary one . Persons who either feel , or find reasons for pretending to feel , a friendship for the borrower , can not take of him more than the ordinary rate of interest : persons , who have no such motive for lending him , will not lend him at all . If they know him for what he is , that will prevent them of course : and even though they should know nothing of him by any other circumstance , the very circumstance of his not being able to find a friend to trust him at the highest ordinary rate , will be sufficient reason to a stranger for looking upon him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , is not likely to pay . The way that prodigals run into debt , after they have spent their substance , is , I take it , by borrowing of their friends and acquaintance , at ordinary interest , or more commonly at no interest , small sums , such as each man may be content to lose , or be ashamed to ask real security for ; and as prodigals have generally an extensive acquaintance ( extensive acquaintance being at once the cause and effect of prodigality ) , the sum total of the money a man may thus find means to squander , may be considerable , tho ' each sum borrowed may , relatively to the circumstances of the lender , have been inconsiderable . This I take to be the race which prodigals , who have spent their all , run at present , under the present system of restraining laws : and this , and no other , I take it , would be the race they would run , were those laws out of the way . Another consideration there is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not compleat before , of the inefficacy of these laws , as to the putting any sort of restraint upon prodigality . This is , that there is another set of people from whom prodigals get what they want , and always will get it , so long as credit lasts , in spite of all laws against high interest ; and , should they find it necessary , at an expence more than equal to an excess of interest they might otherwise have to give . I mean the tradesmen who deal in the goods they want . Every body knows it is much easier to get goods than money . People trust goods upon much slenderer security than they do money : it is very natural they should do so : ordinary profit of trade upon the whole capital employed in a man 's trade , even after the expence of warehouse-rent , journeymen 's wages , and other such general charges are taken into the account , and set against it , is at least equal to double interest ; say 10 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a great deal more , say at least triple interest , 15 per cent : in the way of trading , then , a man can afford to be at least three times as adventurous , as he can in the way of lending , and with equal prudence . So long , then , as a man is looked upon as one who will pay , he can much easier get the goods he wants , than he could the money to buy them with , though he were content to give for it twice , or even thrice the ordinary rate of interest . Supposing any body , for the sake of extraordinary gain , to be willing to run the risk of supplying him , although they did not look upon his personal security to be equal to that of another man , and for the sake of the extraordinary profit to run the extraordinary risk ; in the trader , in short in every sort of trader whom he was accustomed to deal with in his solvent days , he sees a person who may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger from any laws that are , or can be made against usury . How idle , then , to think of stopping a man from making six , or seven , or eight per cent interest , when , if he chuses to run a risk proportionable , he may in this way make thirty or forty per cent or any rate you please . And as to the prodigal , if he can not get what he wants upon these terms , what chance is there of his getting it upon any terms , supposing the laws against usury to be away ? This then is another way , in which , instead of serving ; it injures him , by narrowing his option , and driving him from a market which might have proved less disadvantageous , to a more disadvantageous one . As far as prodigality , then , is concerned , I must confess , I can not see the use of stopping the current of expenditure in this way at the fosset , when there are so many unpreventable ways of letting it run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to society , upon the whole , by letting so much money drop at once out of the pockets of the prodigal , who would have gone on wasting it , into the till of the frugal tradesman , who will lay it up , is not worth the enquiry for the present purpose : what is plain is , that , so far as the saving the prodigal from paying at an extraordinary rate for what he gets to spend , is the object of the law , that object is not at all promoted , by fixing the rate of interest upon money borrowed . On the contrary , if the law has any effect , it runs counter to that object : since , were he to borrow , it would only be , in as far as he could borrow at a rate inferior to that at which otherwise he would be obliged to buy . Preventing his borrowing at an extra-rate , may have the effect of increasing his distress , but can not have the effect of lessening it : allowing his borrowing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his distress , but could not have the effect of increasing it . To put a stop to prodigality , if indeed it be worth while , I know but of one effectual course that can be taken , in addition to the incompleat and insufficient courses at present practicable . and that is , to put the convicted prodigal under an interdict , as was practised formerly among the Romans , and is still practised among the French , and other nations who have taken the Roman law for the ground-work of their own . But to discuss the expediency , or sketch out the details of such an institution . belongs not to the present purpose . LETTER IV Reasons for Restraint . -- Protection of Indigence . Besides prodigals , there are three other classes of persons , and but three , for whose security I can conceive these restrictive laws to have been designed . I mean the indigent , the rashly enterprizing , and the simple : those whose pecuniary necessities may dispose them to give an interest above the ordinary rate . rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may be disposed to venture upon giving such a rate , or from carelessness combined with ignorance , may be disposed to acquiesce in it . In speaking of these three different classes of persons , I must beg leave to consider one of them at a time : and accordingly , in speaking of the indigent , I must consider indigence in the first place as untinctured with simplicity . On this occasion . I may suppose , and ought to suppose , no particular defect in a man 's judgment , or his temper , that should mislead him , more than the ordinary run of men . He knows what is his interest as well as they do , and is as well disposed and able to pursue it as they are . I have already intimated , what I think is undeniable . that there are no one or two or other limited number of rates of interest , that can be equally suited to the unlimited number of situations , in respect of the degree of exigency , in which a man is liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , who by the use of money can make for example 11 per cent , six per cent is as well adapted , as 5 per cent is to the situation of him who can make but 10 ; to that of him who can make 12 per cent seven and so on . So , in the case of his wanting it to save himself from a loss , ( which is that which is most likely to be in view under the name of exigency ) if that loss would amount to 11 per cent 6 per cent is as well adapted to his situation , as 5 per cent would be to the situation of him , who had but a loss amounting to ten per cent to save himself from by the like means . And in any case . though . in proportion to the amount of the loss , the rate of interest were even so great , as that the clear saving should not amount to more than one per cent or any fraction per cent yet so long as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the better for borrowing , even on such comparatively disadvantageous terms . If , instead of gain , we put any other kind of benefit or advantage -- if : instead of loss . we put any other kind of mischief or inconvenience , of equal value , the result will be the same . A man is in one of these situations , suppose , in which it would be for his advantage to borrow . But his circumstances are such , that it would not be worth any body 's while to lend him , at the highest rate which it is proposed the law should allow ; in short , he can not get it at that rate . If he thought he could get it at that rate , most surely he would not give a higher : he may he trusted for that : for by the supposition he has nothing defective in his understanding . But the fact is , he can not get it at that lower rate . At a higher rate , however he could get it : and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his while to get it : so he judges , who has nothing to hinder him from judging right ; who has every motive and every means for forming a right judgment ; who has every motive and every means for informing himself of the circumstances , upon which rectitude of judgment , in the case in question , depends . The legislator , who knows nothing , nor can know any thing , of any one of all these circumstances , who knows nothing at all about the matter , comes and says to him -- " It signifies nothing ; you shall not have the money : for it would be doing you a mischief to let you borrow it upon such terms . " -- And this out of prudence and loving-kindness ! -- There may be worse cruelty . but can there be greater folly ? The folly of those who persist , as is supposed , without reason , in not taking advice , has been much expatiated upon . But the folly of those who persist , without reason , in forcing their advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it is , perhaps , the more frequent , and the more flagrant of the two . It is not often that one man is a better judge for another , than that other is for himself , even in Cases where the adviser will take the trouble to make himself master of as many of the materials for judging , as are within the reach of the person to be advised . But the legislator is not , can not be , in the possession of any one of these materials . -- What private , can be equal to such public folly ? I should now speak of the enterprizing class of borrowers : those . who , when characterized by a single term , are distinguished by the unfavourable appellation of projectors : but in what I shall have to say of them , Dr Smith , I begin to foresee , will bear so material a part , that when I come to enter upon that subject , I think to take my leave of you , and address myself to him . LETTER V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lastly , to the case of the simple . Here , in the first place , I think I am by this time entitled to observe , that no simplicity , short of absolute idiotism , can cause the individual to make a more groundless judgment , than the legislator , who , in the circumstances above stated , should pretend to confine him to any given rate of interest , would have made for him . Another consideration , equally conclusive , is , that were the legislator 's judgment ever so much superior to the individual 's , how weak soever that may be , the exertion of it on this occasion can never be any otherwise than useless , so long as there are so many similar occasions , as there ever must be , where the simplicity of the individual is equally likely to make him a sufferer , and on which the legislator can not interpose with effect , nor has ever so much as thought of interposing . Buying goods with money , or upon credit , is the business of everyday . borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exigency , which , in comparison , can occur but seldom . Regulating the prices of goods in general would be an endless task , and no legislator has ever been weak enough to think of attempting it . And supposing he were to regulate the prices , what would that signify for the protection of simplicity , unless he were to regulate also the quantum of what each man should buy ? Such quantum is indeed regulated , or rather means are taken to prevent buying altogether ; but in what cases ? In those only where the weakness is adjudged to have arrived at such a pitch , as to render a man utterly unqualified for the management of his affairs : in short , when it has arrived at the length of idiocy . But in what degree soever a man 's weakness may expose him to imposition , he stands much more exposed to it , in the way of buying goods , than in the way of borrowing money . To be informed , beforehand , of the ordinary prices of all the sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a task of considerable variety and extent . To be informed of the ordinary rate of interest , is to be informed of one single fact , too interesting not to have attracted attention , and too simple to have escaped the memory . A few per cent enhancement upon the price of goods , is a matter that may easily enough pass unheeded ; but a single per cent beyond the ordinary interest of money , is a stride more conspicuous and startling , than many per cent upon the price of any kind of goods . Even in regard to subjects , which , by their importance would , if any , justify a regulation of their price , such as for instance land , I question whether there ever was an instance where , without some such ground as , on the one side fraud , or suppression of facts necessary to form a judgment of the value , or at least ignorance of such facts , on the other , a bargain was rescinded , merely because a man had sold too cheap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy to give a hundred years purchase instead of thirty , for a piece of land , rather than not have it , I do n't think there is any court in England , or indeed any where else , that would interpose to hinder me , much less to punish the seller with the loss of three times the purchase money , as in the case of usury . Yet when I had got my piece of land , and paid my money , repentance , were the law ever so well disposed to assist me , might be unavailing : for the seller might have spent the money , or gone off with it . But , in the case of borrowing money , it is the borrower always , who , according to the indefinite , or short term for which money is lent , is on the safe side : any imprudence he may have committed with regard to the rate of interest , may be corrected at any time : if I find I have given too high an interest to one man . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a lower rate , and pay off the first : if I Can not find any body to lend me at a lower , there can not be a more certain proof that the first was not in reality too high . But of this hereafter . LETTER VI Mischiefs of the anti-usurious laws . In the preceding letters , I have examined all the modes I can think of , in which the restraints , imposed by the laws against usury , can have been fancied to be of service . I hope it appears by this time , that there are no ways in which those laws can do any good . But there are several , in which they can not but do mischief . The first , I shall mention , is that of precluding so many people , altogether , from the getting the money they stand in need of , to answer their respective exigencies . Think what a distress it would produce , were the liberty of borrowing denied to every body : denied to those who have such security to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer , a sufficient inducement , for a man who has money , to trust them with it . Just that same sort of distress is produced , by denying that liberty to so many people , whose security , though , if they were permitted to add something to that rate , it would be sufficient , is rendered insufficient by their being denied that liberty . Why the misfortune , of not being possessed of that arbitrarily exacted degree of security , should be made a ground for subjecting a man to a hardship , which is not imposed on those who are free from that misfortune , is more than I can see . To discriminate the former class from the latter , I can see hut this one circumstance , viz. that their necessity is greater . This it is by the very supposition : for were it not , they could not be , what they are supposed to be , willing to give more to be relieved from it . In this point of view then , the sole tendency of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief is , that of rendering the terms so much the worse , to a multitude of those , whose circumstances exempt them from being precluded altogether from getting the money they have occasion for . In this case , the mischief , though necessarily less intense than in the other , is much more palpable and conspicuous , Those who can not borrow may get what they want , so long as they have any thing to sell . But while , out of loving-kindness , or whatsoever other motive , the law precludes a man from borrowing , upon terms which he deems too disadvantageous , it does not preclude him from selling , upon any terms , howsoever disadvantageous . Every body knows that forced sales are attended with a loss : and , to this loss , what would be deemed a most extravagant interest bears in general no proportion . When a man 's moveables are taken in execution , they are , I believe , pretty well sold , if , after all expences paid , the produce amounts to two thirds of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the providence and loving-kindness of the law costs him 33 per cent and no more , supposing , what is seldom the case , that no more of the effects are taken than what is barely necessary to make up the money due . If , in her negligence and weakness , she were to suffer him to offer 11 per cent per annum for forbearance , it would be three years before be paid what he is charged with , in the first instance , by her wisdom . Such being the kindness done by the law to the owner of moveables , let us see how it fares with him who has an interest in immoveables . Before the late war , 30 years purchase for land might be reckoned , I think it is pretty well agreed , a medium price . During the distress produced by the war , lands , which it was necessary should be sold , were sold at 20 , 18 , nay , I believe , in some instances , even so low as 15 years purchase . If I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public auction , for which nobody bid so high as fifteen . In many instances , villas , which had been bought before the war , or at the beginning of it , and , in the interval , had been improved rather than impaired , sold for less than half , or even the quarter , of what they had been bought for . I dare not here for my part pretend to be exact : but on this passage , were it worth their notice , Mr Skinner , or Mr Christie , could furnish very instructive notes . Twenty years purchase , instead of thirty , I may be allowed to take , at least for illustration . An estate then of 100 a year , clear of taxes , was devised to a man , charged , suppose , with 1,500 with interest till the money should be paid . Five per cent interest , the utmost which could be accepted from the owner , did not answer the incumbrancer 's purpose : he chose to have the money . But 6 per cent perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most certainly it would have answered the purpose of somebody else : for multitudes there all along were , whose purposes were answered by five per cent The war lasted , I think , seven years : the depreciation of the value of land did not take place immediately : but as , on the other hand , neither did it immediately recover its former price upon the peace , if indeed it has even yet recovered it , we may put seven years for the time , during which it would be more advantageous to pay this extraordinary rate of interest than sell the land , and during which , accordingly , this extraordinary rate of interest would have had to run . One per cent for seven years , is not quite of equal worth to seven per cent the first year : say , however , that it is . The estate , which before the war was worth thirty years purchase , that is 3,000 and which the devisor had given to the devisee for that value , being put up to sale , fetched but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period it would have fetched its original value , 3,000 . Compare , then , the situation of the devisee at the 7 years end , under the law , with what it would have been , without the law . In the former case , the land selling for 20 years purchase , i.e. 2,000 what he would have , after paying the 1,500 is 500 ; which , with the interest of that sum , at 5 per cent for seven years , viz. 175 makes , at the end of that seven years , 675 . In the other case , paying 6 per cent on the 1,500 that is 90 a year , and receiving all that time the rent of the land , viz. 100 he would have had , at the seven years end , the amount of the remaining ten pound during that period , that is 70 in addition to his 1,000. -- 675 substracted from 1,070 leaves 395 . This 395 then , is what he loses out of 1,070 , almost 37 per cent of his capital , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you will find , that , by preventing him from borrowing the money at 6 per cent interest , it makes him nearly as much a sufferer as if he had borrowed it at ten . What I have said hitherto is confined to the case of those who have present value to give , for the money they stand in need of . If they have no such value , then , if they succeed in purchasing assistance upon any terms , it must be in breach of the law ; their lenders exposing themselves to its vengeance : for I speak not here of the accidental case , of its being so constructed as to be liable to evasion . But , even in this case , the mischievous influence of the law still pursues them ; aggravating the very mischief it pretends to remedy . Though it be inefficacious in the way in which the legislator wishes to see it efficacious , it is efficacious in the way opposite to that in which he would wish to see it so . The effect of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be otherwise , and that in two ways . In the first place , a man must , in common prudence , as Dr Smith observes , make a point of being indemnified , not only for whatsoever extraordinary risk it is that he runs , independently of the law , but for the very risk occasioned by the law : he must be insured , as it were , against the law . This cause would operate , were there even as many persons ready to lend upon the illegal rate , as upon the legal . But this is not the case : a great number of persons are , of course , driven out of this competition by the danger of the business ; and another great number , by the disrepute which , under cover of these prohibitory laws or otherwise , has fastened itself upon the name of usurer . So many persons , therefore , being driven out of the trade , it happens in this branch , as it must necessarily in every other , that those who remain have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without confederating , ( for it must be allowed that confederacy in such a case is plainly impossible ) each one will find it easier to push his advantage up to any given degree of exorbitancy , than he would , if there were a greater number of persons of the same stamp to resort to . As to the case , where the law is so worded as to be liable to be evaded , in this case it is partly inefficacious and nugatory , and partly mischievous . It is nugatory , as to all such , whose confidence of its being so is perfect : it is mischievous , as before , in regard to all such who fail of possessing that perfect confidence . If the borrower can find nobody at all who has confidence enough to take advantage of the flaw , he stands precluded from all assistance , as before : and , though he should , yet the lender 's terms must necessarily run the higher , in proportion to what his confidence wants of being perfect . It is not likely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should acknowledge it so to be : it is not likely , at least as matters stand in England , that the worst-penned law made for this purpose should be altogether destitute of effect : and while it has any , that effect , we see , must be in one way or other mischievous . I have already hinted at the disrepute , the ignominy , the reproach , which prejudice , the cause and the effect of these restrictive laws , has heaped upon that perfectly innocent and even meritorious class of men , who , not more for their own advantage than to the relief of the distresses of their neighbour , may have ventured to break through these restraints . It is certainly not a matter of indifference , that a class of persons , who , in every point of view in which their conduct can be placed , whether in relation to their own interest , or in relation to that of the persons whom they have to deal with , as well on the score of prudence , as on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolence , but in as far as it is productive of beneficence ? ) deserve praise rather than censure , should be classed with the abandoned and profligate , and loaded with a degree of infamy , which is due to those only whose conduct is in its tendency the most opposite to their own . " This suffering , " it may be said , " having already been taken account of , is not to be brought to account a second time : they are aware , as you yourself observe , of this inconvenience , and have taken care to get such amends for it , as they themselves look upon as sufficient . " True : but is it sure that the compensation , such as it is , will always , in the event , have proved a sufficient one ? Is there no room here for miscalculation ? May there not be unexpected , unlooked-for incidents , sufficient to turn into bitterness the utmost satisfaction which the difference of pecuniary emolument could afford ? For who can see to the end of that inexhaustible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of reputation ? Who can fathom the abyss of infamy ? At any rate , this article of mischief , if not an addition in its quantity to the others above-noticed , is at least distinct from them in its nature , and as such ought not to be overlooked . Nor is the event of the execution of the law by any means an unexampled one : several such , at different times , have fallen within my notice . Then comes absolute perdition : loss of character , and forfeiture , not of three times the extra-interest , which formed the profit of the offence , but of three times the principal , which gave occasion to it. ( 1* ) The last article I have to mention in the account of mischief , is , the corruptive influence , exercised by these laws , on the morals of the people ; by the pains they take , and can not but take , to give birth to treachery and ingratitude . To purchase a possibility of being enforced , the law neither has found , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find , in this case , any other expedient , than that of hiring a man to break his engagement , and to crush the hand that has been reached out to help him . In the case of informers in general , there has been no troth plighted , nor benefit received . In the case of real criminals invited by rewards to inform against accomplices , it is by such breach of faith that society is held together , as in other cases by the observance of it . In the case of real crimes , in proportion as their mischievousness is apparent , what can not but be manifest even to the criminal , is , that it is by the adherence to his engagement that he would do an injury to society , and , that by the breach of such engagement , instead of doing mischief he is doing good : in the case of usury this is what no man can know , and what one can scarcely think it possible for any man , who , in the character of the borrower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine . He knew that , even in his own judgment , the engagement was a beneficial one to himself , or he would not have entered into it : and nobody else but the lender is affected by it . LETTER VII Efficacy of anti-usurious laws . Before I quit altogether the consideration of the case in which a law , made for the purpose of limiting the rate of interest , may be inefficacious with regard to that end , I can not forbear taking some further notice of a passage already alluded to of Dr Smith 's : because , to my apprehension , that passage seems to throw upon the subject a degree of obscurity , which I could wish to see cleared up , in a future edition of that valuable work . " No law " says he , ( 2* ) " can reduce the common rate of interest below the lowest ordinary market rate , at the time when that law was made . Notwithstanding the edict of 1766 , by which the French king attempted to reduce the rate of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lent in France at five per cent the law being evaded in several different ways . " As to the general position , if so it be , so much , according to me , the better : but I must confess I do not see why this should be the case . It is for the purpose of proving the truth of this general position , that the fact of the inefficacy of this attempt seems to be adduced : for no other proof is adduced but this . But , taking the fact for granted , I do not see how it can be sufficient to support the inference . The law , we are told at the same time , was evaded : but we are not told how it came to be open to evasion . It might be owing to a particular defect in the penning of that particular law ; or , what comes to the same thing , in the provisions made for carrying it into execution . In either case , it affords no support to the general position : nor can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in the case where every provision had been made , that could be made , for giving efficacy to the law . For the position to be true , the case must be , that the law would still be broken , even after every means of what can properly be called evasion had been removed . True or untrue , the position is certainly not self-evident enough to be received without proof : yet nothing is adduced in proof of it , but the fact above-noticed , which we see amounts to no such thing . What is more , I should not expect to find it capable of proof . I do not see , what it is , that should render the law incapable of " reducing the common rate of interest below the lowest ordinary market rate , " but such a state of things , such a combination of circumstances , as should afford obstacles equally powerful , or nearly so , to the efficacy of the law against all higher rates . For destroying the law 's efficacy altogether . I know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of all persons any way privy not to inform : but by such a resolution any higher rate is just as effectually protected as any lower one . Suppose the resolution , strictly speaking , universal , and the law must in all instances be equally inefficacious ; all rates of interest equally free ; and the state of men 's dealings in this way just what it would be , were there no law at all upon the subject . But in this case , the position , in as far as it limits the inefficacy of the law to those rates which are below the " lowest ordinary market rate , " is not true . For my part , I can not conceive how any such universal resolution could have been maintained , or could ever be maintained , without an open concert , and as open a rebellion against government ; nothing of which sort appears to have taken place : and , as to any particular confederacies , they are as capable of protecting any higher rates against the prohibition , as any lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low rate in question . viz. that which was the lowest ordinary market rate immediately before the making of the law , is likely to come in for the protection of the public against the law , more frequently than any other rate . That must be the case on two accounts : first , because by being of the number of the ordinary rates , it was , by the supposition , more frequent than any extraordinary ones : secondly , because the disrepute annexed to the idea of usury , a force which might have more or less efficacy in excluding , from the protection above spoken of , such extraordinary rates , can not well be supposed to apply itself , or at least not in equal degree , to this low and ordinary rate . A lender has certainly less to stop him from taking a rate , which may be taken without disrepute , than from taking one , which a man could not take without subjecting himself to that inconvenience : nor is it likely , that men 's imaginations and sentiments should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stamp disrepute to-day , upon a rate of interest , to which no such accompaniment had stood annexed the day before . Were I to be asked how I imagined the case stood in the particular instance referred to by Dr Smith ; judging from his account of it , assisted by general probabilities , I should answer thus : -- The law , I should suppose , was not so penned as to be altogether proof against evasion . In many instances , of which it is impossible any account should have been taken , it was indeed conformed to : in some of those instances , people who would have lent otherwise , abstained from lending altogether ; in others of those instances , people lent their money at the reduced legal rate . In other instances again , the law was broken : the lenders trusting , partly to expedients recurred to for evading it , partly to the good faith and honour of those whom they had to deal with : in this class of instances it was natural , for the two reasons above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhered to , should have been the most numerous . From the circumstance , not only of their number , but of their more direct repugnancy to the particular recent law in question , they would naturally be the most taken notice of . And this , I should suppose , was the foundation in point of fact for the Doctor 's general position above-mentioned , that " no law can reduce the common rate of interest below the lowest ordinary market rate , at the time when that law was made . " In England , as far as I can trust my judgment and imperfect general recollection of the purport of the laws relative to this matter , I should not suppose that the above position would prove true . That there is no such thing as any palpable and universally-notorious , as well as universally-practicable receipt for that purpose , is manifest from the examples which , as I have already mentioned , every now and then occur , of convictions upon these statutes . Two such receipts , indeed , I shall have occasion to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their nature , or too troublesome or not extensive enough in their application , to have despoiled the law altogether of its terrors or of its preventive efficacy . In the country in which I am writing , the whole system of laws on this subject is perfectly , and very happily , inefficacious . The rate fixed by law is 5 per cent : many people lend money ; and nobody at that rate : the lowest ordinary rate , upon the very best real security , is 8 per cent : 9 , and even 10 , upon such security , are common . Six or seven may have place , now and then , between relations or other particular friends : because , now and then , a man may choose to make a present of one or two per cent to a person whom he means to favour . The contract is renewed from year to year : for a thousand roubles , the borrower , in his written contract , obliges himself to pay at the end of the year one thousand and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , without witnesses , he immediately pays back his 30 roubles , or his 40 roubles , or whatever the sum may be , that is necessary to bring the real rate of interest to the rate verbally agreed on . This contrivance , I take it , would not do in England : but why it would not , is a question which it would be in vain for me to pretend , at this distance from all authorities , to discuss . LETTER VIII Virtual Usury allowed . Having proved , as I hope , by this time , the utter impropriety of the law 's limiting the rate of interest , in every case that can be conceived , it may be rather matter of curiosity , than any thing else , to enquire , how far the law , on this head , is consistent with itself , and with any principles upon which it can have built . 1 . Drawing and re-drawing is a practice , which it will be sufficient here to hint at . It is perfectly well known to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merchants , by consulting Dr Smith . In this way , he has shewn how money may be , and has been , taken up , at so high a rate , as 13 or 14 per cent -- a rate nearly three times as high as the utmost which the law professes to allow . The extra interest is in this case masked under the names of commission , and price of exchange . The commission is but small upon each loan , not more , I think , than 1/2 per cent : custom having stretched so far but no farther , it might be thought dangerous , perhaps , to venture upon any higher allowance under that name . The charge , being repeated a number of times in the course of the year , makes up in frequency what it wants in weight . The transaction is by this shift rendered more troublesome , indeed , but not less practicable , to such parties as are agreed about it . But if usury is good for merchants , I do n't very well see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this distance from all the mountains of legal knowledge , I will not pretend to say , whether the practice of selling accepted bills at an under value , would hold good against all attacks . It strikes my recollection as a pretty common one , and I think it could not be brought under any of the penal statutes against usury . The adequateness of the consideration might , for aught I know , be attacked with success , in a court of equity ; or , perhaps , if there were sufficient evidence ( which the agreement of the parties might easily prevent ) by an action at common law , for money had and received . If the practice be really proof against all attacks , it seems to afford an effectual , and pretty commodious method of evading the restrictive laws . The only restraint is , that it requires the assistance of a third person , a friend of the borrower 's ; as for instance : B , the real borrower , wants 100 and finds U , a usurer , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent B. has F , a friend , who has not the money himself to lend him , but is willing to stand security for him , to that amount . B. therefore draws upon F , and F. accepts , a bill of 100 at 5 per cent interest , payable at the end of a twelvemonth from the date . F. draws a like bill upon B. : each sells his bill to U. for fifty pound ; and it is indorsed to U. accordingly . The 50 that F. receives . he delivers over without any consideration to B. This transaction , if it be a valid one , and if a man can find such a friend , is evidently much less troublesome than the practice of drawing and re-drawing . And this , if it be practicable at all , may be practised by persons of any description , concerned or not in trade . Should the effect of this page be to suggest an expedient , and that a safe and commodious one , for evading the laws against usury , to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred , it will not lie very heavy upon my conscience . The prayers of usurers , whatever efficacy they may have in lightening the burthen , I hope I may lay some claim to . And I think you will not now wonder at my saying , that in the efficacy of such prayers I have not a whit less confidence , than in that of the prayers of any other class of men . One apology I shall have to plead at any rate , that in pointing out these flaws , to the individual who may be disposed to creep out at them , I point them out at the same time to the legislator , in whose power it is to stop them up , if in his opinion they require it . If , notwithstanding such opinion , he should omit to do so , the blame will lie , not on my industry , but on his negligence . These , it may be said , should they even be secure and effectual evasions , are still but evasions , and , if chargeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistencies but as oversights . Be it so . Setting these aside , then , as expedients practised or practicable , only behind its back , I will beg leave to remind you of two others , practised from the day of its birth , under its protection and before its face . The first I shall mention is pawnbroking . In this case there is the less pretence for more than ordinary interest , inasmuch as the security is , in this case , not only equal to , but better than , what it can be in any other : to wit , the present possession of a moveable thing , of easy sale , on which the creditor has the power , and certainly does not want the inclination , to set such price as is most for his advantage . If there be a case in which the allowing of such extraordinary interest is attended with more danger than another , it must be this : which is so particularly adapted to the situation of the lowest poor , that is , of those who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are most open to imposition . This trade however the law , by regulating , avowedly protects . What the rate of interest is , which it allows to be taken in this way , I can not take upon me to remember : but I am much deceived , if it amounts to less than 12 per cent in the year , and I believe it amounts to a good deal more . Whether it were 12 per cent or 1200 , I believe would make in practice but little difference . What commission is in the business of drawing and re-drawing , warehouse-room is , in that of pawnbroking . Whatever limits then are set to the profits of this trade , are set , I take it , not by the vigilancy of the law , but , as in the case of other trades , by the competition amongst the traders . Of the other regulations contained in the acts relative to this subject , I recollect no reason to doubt the use . The other instance is that of bottomry and respondentia : for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be spoken of together . Bottomry is the usury of pawnbroking : respondentia is usury at large , but combined in a manner with insurance , and employed in the assistance of a trade carried on by sea . If any species of usury is to be condemned , I see not on what grounds this particular species can be screened from the condemnation . " Oh but " ( says Sir William Blackstone , or any body else who takes upon himself the task of finding a reason for the law ) " this is a maritime country , and the trade , which it carries on by sea , is the great bulwark of its defence . " It is not necessary I should here enquire , whether that branch , which , as Dr Smith has shewn , is , in every view but the mere one of defence , less beneficial to a nation , than two others out of the four branches which comprehend all trade , has any claim to be preferred to them in this or any other way . I admit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no more than what it is perfectly right it should enjoy . What I want to know is , what there is in the class of men , embarked in this trade , that should render beneficial to them , a liberty , which would be ruinous to every body else . Is it that sea adventures have less hazard on them than land adventures ? or that the sea teaches those , who have to deal with it , a degree of forecast and rejection which has been denied to land men ? It were easy enough to give farther and farther extension to this charge of inconsistency , by bringing under it the liberty given to insurance in all its branches , to the purchase and sale of annuities , and of post-obits , in a word to all cases where a man is permitted to take upon himself an unlimited degree of risk , receiving for so doing an unlimited compensation . Indeed I know not where the want of instances would stop me : for in what part of the magazine of events , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found ? But to this head of argument , this argument ad hominem , as it may be called , the Use of which is but subsidiary , and which has more of confutation in it than of persuasion or instruction , I willingly put an end . LETTER IX Blackstone considered . I hope you are , by this time , at least , pretty much of my opinion , that there is just the same sort of harm , and no other , in making the best terms one can for one 's self in a money loan , as there is in any other sort of bargain . If you are not , Blackstone however is , whose opinion I hope you will allow to be worth something . In speaking of the rate of interest , ( 3* ) he starts a parallel between a bargain for the loan of money , and a bargain about a horse , and pronounces , without hesitation , that the harm of making too good a bargain , is just as great in the one case , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what you lawyers call , the principal case , he drops the horse-business , as soon as it has answered the purpose of illustration , which it was brought to serve . But as , in my conception , as well the reasoning by which he supports the decision , as that by which any body else could have supported it , is just as applicable to the one sort of bargain as to the other , I will carry on the parallel a little farther , and give the same extent to the reasoning , as to the position which it is made use of to support . This extension will not be without its use ; for if the position , when thus extended , should be found just , a practical inference will arise ; which is , that the benefits of these restraints ought to be extended from the money-trade to the horse-trade . That my own opinion is not favourable to such restraints in either case , has been sufficiently declared ; but if more respectable opinions than mine are still to prevail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sort of bargain which the learned commentator has happened to pitch upon for the illustration , is indeed , in the case illustrating , as in the case illustrated . a loan : but as , to my apprehension , loan or sale makes , in point of reasoning , no sort of difference , and as the utility of the conclusion will , in the latter case , be more extensive . I shall adapt the reasoning to the more important business of selling horses , instead of the less important one of lending them . A circumstance , that would render the extension of these restraints. to the horse-trade more smooth and easy . is , that in the one track , as well as in the other , the public has already got the length of calling names . Jockey-ship , a term of reproach not less frequently applied to the arts of those who sell horses than to the arts of those who ride them , sounds , I take it , to the ear of many a worthy gentleman , nearly as bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who put their trust in proverbs , and not less to those who put their trust in party , that when we have got a dog to hang , who is troublesome and keeps us at bay , whoever can contrive to fasten a bad name to his tail , has gained more than half the battle . I now proceed with my application . The words in italics are my own : all the rest are Sir William Blackstone 's : and I restore , at bottom , the words I was obliged to discard , in order to make room for mine . " To demand an exorbitant price is equally contrary to conscience , for the loan of a horse , or for the loan of a sum of money . but a reasonable equivalent for the temporary inconvenience , which the owner may feel by the want of it , and for the hazard of his losing it entirely , is not more immoral in one case than in the other ... " As to selling horses , a capital distinction must be made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former of which we give the name of horse-dealing , ( 4* ) to the latter the truly odious appellation of jockey-ship : ( 5* ) the former is necessary in every civil state , if it were but to exclude the latter . For , as the whole of this matter is well summed up by Grotius , if the compensation allowed by law does not exceed the proportion of the inconvenience which it is to the seller of the horse to part with it , ( 6* ) or the want which the buyer has of it , ( 7* ) its allowance is neither repugnant to the revealed law , nor to the natural law : but if it exceeds these bounds , it is then an oppressive jockey-ship : ( 8* ) and though the municipal laws may give it impunity , they never can make it just . " We see , that the exorbitance or moderation of the price given for a horse(9*) depends upon two circumstances : upon the inconvenience of parting with the horse one has , ( 10* ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 11* ) The inconvenience to individual sellers of horses , ( 12* ) can never be estimated by laws ; the general price for horses(13*) must depend therefore upon the usual or general inconvenience . This results entirely from the quantity of horses(14*) in the kingdom : for the more horses(15*) there are running about(16*) in any nation , the greater superfluity there will be beyond what is necessary to carry on the business of the mail coaches(17*) and the common concerns of life . In every nation or public community there is a certain quantity of horses(18*) then necessary , which a person well skilled in political arithmetic might perhaps calculate as exactly as a private horse-dealer(19*) can the demand for running horses in his own stables : ( 20* ) all above this necessary quantity may be spared , or lent , or sold , without much inconvenience to the respective lenders or sellers : and the greater the national superfluity is , the more numerous will be the sellers , ( 21* ) and the lower ought the national price of horseflesh ( 22* ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely enough spare horses(23*) to answer the ordinary uses of the pubic , horse-flesh(24*) will be proportionably high : for sellers(25*) will be but few , as few can submit to the inconvenience of selling . " ( 26* ) -- So far the learned commentator . I hope by this time you are worked up to a proper pitch of indignation , at the neglect and inconsistency betrayed by the law , in not suppressing this species of jockey-ship , which it would be so easy to do , only by fixing the price of horses . Nobody is less disposed than I am to be uncharitable : but when one thinks of the 1500 taken for Eclipse , and 2000 for Rockingham , and so on , who can avoid being shocked , to think how little regard those who took such enormous prices must have had for " the law of revelation and the law of nature ? " Whoever it is that is to move for the municipal law , not long ago talked of , for reducing the rate of interest , whenever that motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Yorkshire members to get up , and move , by way of addition , for a clause for fixing and reducing the price of horses . I need not expatiate on the usefulness of that valuable species of cattle , which might have been as cheap as asses before now , if our lawgivers had been as mindful of their duty in the suppression of jockey-ship , as they have been in the suppression of usury . It may be said , against fixing the price of horse-flesh , that different horses may be of different values . I answer -- and I think I shall shew you as much , when I come to touch upon the subject of champerty -- not more different than the values which the use of the same sum of money may be of to different persons , on different occasions . LETTER X Grounds of the Prejudices against Usury . It is one thing , to find reasons why it is fit a law should have been made : it is another to find the reasons why it was made : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law : it is another thing to account for its existence . In the present instance , the former task , if the observations I have been troubling you with are just , is an impossible one . The other , though not necessary for conviction , may contribute something perhaps in the way of satisfaction . To trace an error to its fountain head , says lord Coke , is to refute it ; and many men there are who , till they have received this satisfaction , be the error what it may , can not prevail upon themselves to part with it . " If our ancestors have been all along under a mistake , how came they to have fallen into it ? " is a question that naturally presents itself upon all such occasions . The case is , that in matters of law more especially , such is the dominion of authority over our minds , and such the prejudice it creates in favour of whatever institution it has taken under its wing , that , after all manner of reasons that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been shewn to be insufficient , we still can not forbear looking to some unassignable and latent reason for its efficient cause . But if , instead of any such reason , we can find a cause for it in some notion , of the erroneousness of which we are already satisfied , then at last we are content to give it up without further struggle ; and then , and not till then , our satisfaction is compleat . In the conceptions of the more considerable part of those through whom our religion has been handed down to us , virtue , or rather godliness , which was an improved substitute for virtue , consisted in self-denial : not in self-denial for the sake of society , but of self-denial for its own sake . One pretty general rule served for most occasions : not to do what you had a mind to do ; or , in other words , not to do what would be for your advantage . By this of course was meant temporal advantage : to which spiritual advantage was understood to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a resolution , on the part of a being of perfect power and benevolence , to make his few favourites happy in a state in which they were to be , was his determined pleasure , that they should keep themselves as much strangers to happiness as possible , in the state in which they were . Now to get money is what most men have a mind to do : because he who has money gets , as far as it goes , most other things that he has a mind for . Of course nobody was to get money : indeed why should he , when he was not so much as to keep what he had got already ? To lend money at interest , is to get money , or at least to try to get it : of course it was a bad thing to lend money upon such terms . The better the terms , the worse it was to lend upon them : but it was bad to lend upon any terms , by which any thing could be got . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting like a Jew : for though all Christians at first were Jews , and continued to do as Jews did , after they had become Christians , yet , in process of time , it came to be discovered , that the distance between the mother and the daughter church could not be too wide . By degrees , as old conceits gave place to new , nature so far prevailed , that the objections to getting money in general , were pretty well over-ruled : but still this Jewish way of getting it , was too odious to be endured . Christians were too intent upon plaguing Jews , to listen to the suggestion of doing as Jews did , even though money were to be got by it . Indeed the easier method , and a method pretty much in vogue , was , to let the Jews get the money any how they could , and then squeeze it out of them as it was wanted . In process of time , as questions of all sorts came under discussion , and this , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it found no unopportune support in a passage of Aristotle : that celebrated heathen , who , in all matters wherein heathenism did not destroy his competence , had established a despotic empire over the Christian world . As fate would have it , that great philosopher , with all his industry , and all his penetration , notwithstanding the great number of pieces of money that had passed through his hands ( more perhaps than ever passed through the hands of philosopher before or since ) , and notwithstanding the uncommon pains he had bestowed on the subject of generation , had never been able to discover , in any one piece of money , any organs for generating any other such piece . Emboldened by so strong a body of negative proof , he ventured at last to usher into the world the result of his observations , in the form of an universal proposition , that all money is in its nature barren . You , my friend , to whose cast of mind sound reason is much more congenial than ancient philosophy , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarking , that the practical inference from this shrewd observation , if it afforded any , should have been , that it would be to no purpose for a man to try to get five per cent out of money -- not , that if he could contrive to get so much , there would be any harm in it . But the sages of those days did not view the matter in that light . A consideration that did not happen to present itself to that great philosopher , but which had it happened to present itself , might not have been altogether unworthy of his notice , is , that though a daric would not beget another daric , any more than it would a ram , or an ewe , yet for a daric which a man borrowed , he might get a ram and a couple of ewes , and that the ewes , were the ram left with them a certain time , would probably not be barren . That then , at the end of the year , he would find himself master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , lambs ; and that , if he sold his sheep again to pay back his daric , and gave one of his lambs for the use of it in the mean time , he would be two lambs , or at least one lamb , richer than if he had made no such bargain . These theological and philosophical conceits , the offspring of the day , were not ill seconded by principles of a more permanent complexion . The business of a money-lender , though only among Christians , and in Christian times , a proscribed profession , has no where , nor at any time , been a popular one . Those who have the resolution to sacrifice the present to future , are natural objects of envy to those who have sacrificed the future to the present . The children who have eat their cake are the natural enemies of the children who have theirs . While the money is hoped for , and for a short time after it has been received , he who lends it is a friend and benefactor : by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of reckoning is come , the benefactor is found to have changed his nature , and to have put on the tyrant and the oppressor . It is an oppression for a man to reclaim his own money : it is none to keep it from him . Among the inconsiderate , that is among the great mass of mankind , selfish affections conspire with the social in treasuring up all favour for the man of dissipation , and in refusing justice to the man of thrift who has supplied him . In some shape or other that favour attends the chosen object of it , through every stage of his career . But , in no stage of his career , can the man of thrift come in for any share of it . It is the general interest of those with whom a man lives , that his expence should be at least as great as his circumstances will bear . because there are few expences which a man can launch into , but what the benefit of it is shared , in some proportion or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle originates a standing law , forbidding every man , on pain of infamy , to confine his expences Within what is adjudged to be the measure of his means , saving always the power of exceeding that limit , as much as he thinks proper : and the means assigned him by that law may be ever so much beyond his real means , but are sure never to fall short of them . So close is the combination thus formed between the idea of merit and the idea of expenditure , that a disposition to spend finds favour in the eyes even of those who know that a man 's circumstances do not entitle him to the means : and an upstart , whose chief recommendation is this disposition , shall find himself to have purchased a permanent fund of respect , to the prejudice of the very persons at whose expence he has been gratifying his appetites and his pride . The lustre , which the display of borrowed wealth has diffused over his character ; awes men , during the season of his prosperity , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adversity has overtaken him at last , the recollection of the height , from which he has fallen , throw the veil of compassion over his injustice . The condition of the man of thrift is the reverse . His lasting opulence procures him a share , at least , of the same envy , that attends the prodigal 's transient display : but the use he makes of it procures him no part of the favour which attends the prodigal . In the satisfactions he derives from that use , the pleasure of possession , and the idea of enjoying , at some distant period , which may never arrive , nobody comes in for any share . In the midst of his opulence he is regarded as a kind of insolvent , who refuses to honour the bills , which their rapacity would draw upon him , and who is by so much the more criminal than other insolvents , as not having the plea of inability for an excuse . Could there be any doubt of the disfavour which attends the cause of the money-lender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition of the public judgment to sacrifice the interest of the former to that of the latter , the stage would afford a compendious , but a pretty conclusive proof of it . It is the business of the dramatist to study , and to conform to , the humours and passions of those , on the pleasing of whom he depends for his success : it is the course which reflection must suggest to every man , and which a man would naturally fall into , though he were not to think about it . He may , and very frequently does , make magnificent pretences , of giving the law to them : but wo be to him that attempts to give them any other law than what they are disposed already to receive . If he would attempt to lead them one inch , it must be with great caution , and not without suffering himself to be led by them at least a dozen . Now , I question , whether , among all the instances in which a borrower and a lender of money have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of Thespis to the present , there ever was one , in which the former was not recommended to favour in some shape or other , either to admiration , or to love , or to pity , or to all three ; and the other , the man of thrift , consigned to infamy . Hence it is that , in reviewing and adjusting the interests of these apparently rival parties , the advantage made by the borrower is so apt to slip out of sight , and that made by the lender to appear in so exaggerated a point of view . Hence it is , that though prejudice is so far softened as to acquiesce in the lender 's making some advantage , lest the borrower should lose altogether the benefit of his assistance , yet still the borrower is to have all the favour , and the lender 's advantage is for ever to be clipped , and pared down , as low as it will bear . First it was to be confined to ten per cent , then to eight , then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a report of its being to be brought down to four . with constant liberty to sink as much lower as it would . The burthen of these restraints , of course , has been intended exclusively for the lender : in reality , as I think you have seen , it presses much more heavily upon the borrower : I mean him who either becomes or in vain wishes to become so . But the presents directed by prejudice , Dr Smith will tell us , are not always delivered according to their address . It was thus that the mill-stone designed for the necks of those vermin , as they have been called , the dealers in corn , was found to fall upon the heads of the consumers . It is thus -- but further examples would lead me further from the purpose . LETTER XI Compound Interest . A word or two I must trouble you with , concerning compound interest ; for compound interest is discountenanced by the law . I suppose , as a sort of usury . That , without an express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember : whether , in case . of an express stipulation , the law allows it to be taken , I am not absolutely certain . I should suppose it might : remembering covenants in mortgages that interest should become principal . At any rate , I think the law can not well punish it under the name of usury . If the discountenance shewn to this arrangement be grounded on the horror of the sin of usury , the impropriety of such discountenance follows of course , from the arguments which shew the un- " sinfulness of that sin . " Other argument against it , I believe , was never attempted , unless it were the giving to such an arrangement the epithet of a hard one : in doing which , something more like a reason is given , than one gets in ordinary from the common law . If that consistency were to be found in the common law , which has never yet been found in man 's conduct , and which perhaps is hardly in man 's nature , compound interest never could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , I dare to say , very good : the effects of it are , I am certain , very pernicious . If the borrower pays the interest at the day , if he performs his engagement , that very engagement to which the aw pretends to oblige him to conform , the lender , who receives that interest , makes compound interest of course , by lending it out again , unless he chooses rather to expend it : he expects to receive it at the day , or what meant the engagement ? if he fails of receiving it , he is by so much a loser . The borrower , by paying it at the day , is no loser : if he does not pay it at the day , he is by so much a gainer : a pain of disappointment takes place in the case of the one , while no such pain takes place in the case of the other . The cause of him whose contention is to catch a gain , is thus preferred to that of him whose contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and useful maxim of that branch of the common law which has acquired the name of equity . The gain , which the law in its tenderness thus bestows on the defaulter , is an encouragement , a reward , which it holds out for breach of faith , for iniquity , for indolence , for negligence . The loss , which it thus throws upon the forbearing lender , is a punishment which it inflicts on him for his forbearance : the power which it gives him of avoiding that loss , by prosecuting the borrower upon the instant of failure , is thus converted into a reward which it holds out to him for his hard-heartedness and rigour . Man is not quite so good as it were to be wished he were ; but he would be bad indeed , were he bad on all the occasions where the law , as far as depends on her , has made it his interest so to be . It may be impossible , say you , it often is impossible , for the borrower to pay the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the inference ? That the creditor should not have it in his power to ruin the debtor for not paying at the day , and that he should receive a compensation for the loss occasioned by such failure . -- He has it in his power to ruin him , and he has it not in his power to obtain such compensation . The judge , were it possible for a arrested debtor to find his way into a judge 's chamber instead of a spunging-house , might award a proper respite , suited to the circumstances of the parties . It is not possible : but a respite is purchased , proper or not proper , perhaps at ten times , perhaps at a hundred times the expence of compound interest , by putting in bail , and fighting the creditor through all the windings of mischievous and unnecessary delay . Of the satisfaction due either for the original failure , or for the subsequent vexation by which it has been aggravated , no part is ever received by the injured creditor : but the instruments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debtor 's , perhaps ten times , perhaps a hundred times the amount of that satisfaction . Such is the result of this tenderness of the law . It is in consequence of such tenderness that on so many occasions a man , though ever so able , would find himself a loser by paying his just debts : those very debts of which . the law has recognized the justice . The man who obeys the dictates of common honesty , the man who does what the law pretends to bid him , is wanting to himself . Hence your regular and securely profitable writs of error in the house of lords : hence your random and vindictive costs of one hundred pounds , and two hundred pounds , now and then given in that house . It is natural , and it is something , to find , in a company of lords , a zeal for justice : it is not natural , to find , in such a company , a disposition to bend down to the toil of calculation . LETTER XII Maintenance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down , and , as I flatter myself , to make good , the general principle , that no man of ripe years , and of sound mind , ought , out of loving kindness to him , to be hindered from making such bargain , in the way of obtaining money , as , acting with his eyes open , he deems conducive to his interest , I will take your leave for pushing it a little farther , and extending the application of it to another class of regulations still less defensible . I mean the antique laws against what are called Maintenance and Champerty . To the head of Maintenance , I think you refer , besides other offences which are not to the present purpose , that of purchasing , upon any terms , any claim , which it requires a suit at law , or in equity , to enforce . Champerty , which is but a particular modification of this sin of Maintenance , is , I think , the furnishing a man who has such a claim , with regard to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , to carry on such claim , upon the terms of receiving a part of the estate in case of success . What the penalties are for these offences I do not recollect , nor do I think it worth while hunting for them , though I have Blackstone at my elbow . They are , at any rate , sufficiently severe to answer the purpose , the rather as the bargain is made void . To illustrate the mischievousness of the laws by which they have been created , give me leave to tell you a story , which is but too true an one , and which happened to fall within my own observation . A gentleman of my acquaintance had succeeded , during his minority , to an estate of about 3,000 a year ; I wo n't say where . His guardian , concealing from him the value of the estate , which circumstances rendered it easy for him to do , got a conveyance of it from him , during his nonage , for a trifle . Immediately upon the ward 's coming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found means to get the conveyance confirmed . Some years afterwards , the ward discovered the value of the inheritance he had been throwing away . Private representations proving , as it may be imagined , ineffectual , he applied to a court of equity . The suit was in some forwardness : the opinion of the ablest counsel highly encouraging : but money there remained none . We all know but too well , that , in spite of the unimpeachable integrity of the bench , that branch of justice , which is particularly dignified with the name of equity , is only for those who can afford to throw away one fortune for the chance of recovering another . Two persons , however , were found , who , between them , were content to defray the expence of the ticket for this lottery , on condition of receiving half the prize . The prospect now became encouraging : when unfortunately one of the adventurers , in exploring the recesses of the bottomless pit , happened to dig up one of the old statutes against Champerty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understanding that , some how or other , his antagonist had found support , had thought fit in the mean time to propose terms , which the plaintiff , after his support had thus dropped from under him , was very glad to close with . He received , I think it was , 3,000 : and for that he gave up the estate , which was worth about as much yearly , together with the arrears , which were worth about as much as the estate . Whether , in the barbarous age which gave birth to these barbarous precautions , whether , even under the zenith of feudal anarchy , such fettering regulations could have had reason on their side , is a question of curiosity rather than use . My notion is , that there never was a time , that there never could have been , or can be a time , when the pushing of suitors away from court with one hand , while they are beckoned into . it with another , would not be a policy equally faithless , inconsistent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that , to the times which called forth these laws , and in which alone they could have started up , the present are as opposite as light to darkness . A mischief , in those times , it seems , but too common , though a mischief not to be cured by such laws , was , that a man would buy a weak claim , in hopes that power . might convert it into a strong one , and that the sword of a baron , stalking into court with a rabble of retainers at his heels , might strike terror into the eyes of a judge upon the bench . At present , what cares an English judge for the swords of an hundred barons ? -- Neither fearing nor hoping , hating nor loving , the judge of our days is ready with equal phlegm to administer , upon all occasions , that system , whatever it be , of justice , or injustice , which the law has put into his hands . A disposition so consonant to duty could not have then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished . Wealth has indeed the monopoly of justice against poverty : and such monopoly it is the direct tendency and necessary effect of regulations like these to strengthen and confirm . But with this monopoly no judge that lives now is at all chargeable . The law created this monopoly : the law , whenever it pleases , may dissolve it . I will not however so far wander from my subject as to enquire what measure might have been necessary to afford a full relief to the case of that unfortunate gentleman , any more than to the cases of so many other gentlemen who might be found , as unfortunate as he . I will not insist upon so strange and so inconceivable an arrangement , as that of the judge 's seeing both parties face to face in the first instance , observing what the facts are in dispute , and declaring , that as the facts should turn out this way or that way , such or such would be his decree . At present , I confine myself to the removal of such part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceit of keeping men out of difficulties , by cutting them off from such means of relief as each man 's situation may afford . A spunge in this , as in so many other cases , is the only needful , and only availing remedy : one stroke of it for the musty laws against maintenance and champerty : another for the more recent ones against usury . Consider , for example , what would have respectively been the effect of two such strokes , in the case of the unfortunate gentleman I have been speaking of . By the first , if what is called equity has any claim to confidence , he would have got , even after paying off his champerty-usurers , 1500 a year in land , and about as much in money : instead of getting , and that only by an accident , 3000 once told . By the other , there is no saving to what a degree he might have been benefited . May I be allowed to stretch so far in favour of the law as to suppose , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his suit , in the course of about three years ? I am sensible , that may be thought but a short sum , and this but a short term , for a suit in equity : but , for the purpose of illustration , it may serve as well as a longer . Suppose he had sought this necessary sum in the way of borrowing ; and had been so fortunate , or , as the laws against the sin of usury would stile it , so unfortunate , as to get it at 200 per cent . He would then have purchased his 6000 a year at the price of half as much once paid , viz , 3000 ; instead of selling it at that price . Whether , if no such laws against usury had been in being , he could have got the money , even at that rate , I will not pretend to say : perhaps he might not have got it under ten times that rate , perhaps he might have got it at the tenth part of that rate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might , and probably would , have been the better for the repeal of those laws : but thus far we must say , that it is impossible he should have been the worse . The terms , upon which he met with adventurers willing to relieve him , though they come not within that scanty field , which the law , in the narrowness of its views , calls usury , do , in the present case , at twenty years purchase of the 3000 a year he was content to have sacrificed for such assistance , amount , in effect , to 4000 per cent . Whether it was likely that any man , who was disposed to venture his money , at all , upon such a chance , would have thought of insisting upon such a rate of interest , I will leave you to imagine : but thus much may be said with confidence , because the fact demonstrates it , that , at a rate not exceeding this , the sum would actually have been supplied . Whatever becomes then of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when applied to the laws against usury , ought , I think , to be sufficient to convince us , that so long as the expence of seeking relief at law stands on its present footing , the purpose of seeking that relief will , of itself , independently of every other , afford a sufficient ground for allowing any man , or every man , to borrow money on any terms on which he can obtain it . Crichoff , in White Russia , March 1 787 . LETTER XIII To Dr. Smith , on Projects in Arts , &amp;c . SIR , I forget what son of controversy it was , among the Greeks , who having put himself to school to a professor of eminence , to learn what , in those days , went by the name of wisdom , chose an attack upon his master for the first public specimen of his proficiency . This specimen , whatever entertainment it might have afforded to the audience , afforded , it may be supposed , no great satisfaction to the master : for the thesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains . For my part , being about to shew myself in one respect as ungrateful as the Greek , it may be a matter of prudence for me to look out for something like candour by way of covering to my ingratitude : instead therefore of pretending to owe you nothing , I shall begin with acknowledging , that , as far as your track coincides with mine , I should come much nearer the truth , were I to say I owed you every thing . Should it be my fortune to gain any advantage over you , it must be with weapons which you have taught me to wield , and with which you yourself have furnished me : for , as all the great standards of truth , which can be appealed to in this line , owe , as far as I can understand , their establishment to you , I can see scarce any other way of convicting you of any error or oversight , than by judging you out of your own mouth . In the series of letters to which this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my researches into the policy of the laws fixing the rate of interest , combating such arguments as fancy rather than observation had suggested to my view , when , on a sudden , recollection presented me with your formidable image , bestriding the ground over which I was travelling pretty much at my ease , and opposing the shield of your authority to any arguments I could produce . It was a reflection mentioned by Cicero as affording him some com . fort , that the employment his talents till that time had met with , had been chiefly on the defending side . How little soever blest , on any occasion , with any portion of his eloquence , I may , on the present occasion , however , indulge myself with a portion of what constituted his comfort : for , if I presume to contend with you , it is only in defence of what I look upon as , not only an innocent , but a most meritorious race of men , who are so unfortunate as to have fallen under the rod of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name I understand you to comprehend , in particular , all such persons as , in the pursuit of wealth , strike out into any new channel , and more especially into any channel of invention . It is with the professed view of checking , or rather of crushing , these adventurous spirits , whom you rank with " prodigals " , that you approve of the laws which limit the rate of interest , grounding yourself on the tendency , they appear to you to have , to keep the capital of the country out of two such different sets of hands . The passage , I am speaking of , is in the fourth chapter of your second book , volume the second of the 8vo edition of 1784 . " The legal rate " ( you say ) " it is to be observed , though it ought to be somewhat above , ought not to be much above , the lowest market rate . If the legal rate of interest in Great Britain , for example , was fixed so high as eight or ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be lent , would be lent to prodigals and projectors , who alone would be willing to give this high interest . Sober people , who will give for the use of money no more than a part of what they are likely to make by the use of it , would not venture into the competition . A great part of the capital of the country would thus be kept out of the hands which were most likely to make a profitable and advantageous use of it , and thrown into those which were most likely to waste and destroy it . Where the legal interest , on the contrary , is fixed but a very little above the lowest market rate , sober people are universally preferred as borrowers , to prodigals and projectors . The person who lends money , gets nearly as much interest from the former , as he dares to take from the latter , and his money is much safer in the hands of the one set of people than in those of the other . A great part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which it is most likely to be employed with advantage . " It happens fortunately for the side you appear to have taken , and as unfortunately for mine , that the appellative , which the custom of the language has authorized you , and which the poverty and perversity of the language has in a manner forced you , to make use of , is one , which , along with the idea of the sort of persons in question , conveys the idea of reprobation , as indiscriminately and deservedly applied to them . With what justice or consistency , or by the influence of what causes , this stamp of indiscriminate reprobation has been thus affixed , it is not immediately necessary to enquire . But , that it does stand thus affixed , you and every body else , I imagine , will be ready enough to allow . This being the case , the question stands already decided , in the first instance at least , if not irrevocably , in the judgments of all those , who , unable or unwilling to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds to be led captive by the tyranny of sounds ; that is , I doubt , of by far the greater proportion of those whom we are likely to have to judge us . In the conceptions of all such persons , to ask whether it be fit to restrain projects and projectors , will be as much as to ask , whether it be fit to restrain rashness , and folly , and absurdity , and knavery , and waste . Of prodigals I shall say no more at present . I have already stated my reasons for thinking , that it is not among them that we are to look for the natural customers for money at high rates of interest . As far as those reasons are conclusive , it will follow , that , of the two sorts of men you mention as proper objects of the burthen of these restraints , prodigals and projectors , that burthen falls exclusively on the latter . As to these , what your definition is of projectors , and what descriptions of persons you meant to include under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of judging of the propriety of that censure , but makes no difference in judging of the propriety of the law , which that censure is employed to justify . Whether you yourself , were the several classes of persons made to pass before you in review , would be disposed to pick out this or that class , or this and that individual , in order to exempt them from such censure , is what for that purpose we have no need to enquire . The law , it is certain , makes no such distinctions : it falls with equal weight , and with all its weight , upon all those persons , without distinction to whom the term Projectors , in the most unpartial and extensive signification of which it is capable , can be applied . It falls at any rate ( to repeat some of the words of my former definition ) , upon all such persons , as , in the pursuit of wealth , or even of any other object , endeavour , by the assistance of wealth , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all such persons , as , in the cultivation of any of those arts which have been by way of eminence termed useful , direct their endeavours to any of those departments in which their utility shines most conspicuous and indubitable ; upon all such persons as , in the line of any of their pursuits , aim at any thing that can be called improvement ; whether it consist in the production of any new article adapted to man 's use , or in the meliorating the quality , or diminishing the expence , of any of those which are already known to us . It falls , in short , upon every application of the human powers , in which ingenuity stands in need of wealth for its assistant . High and extraordinary rates of interest , how little soever adapted to the situation of the prodigal , are certainly , as you very justly observe , particularly adapted to the situation of the projector : not however to that of the imprudent projector only , nor even to his case more than another 's , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of such a being were to be supposed . Whatever be the prudence or other qualities of the project , in whatever circumstance the novelty of it may lie , it has this circumstance against it , viz. that it is new . But the rates of interest , the highest rates allowed , are , as you expressly say they are , and as you would have them to be , adjusted to the situation which the sort of trader is in , whose trade runs in the old channels , and to the best security which such channels can afford . But in the nature of things , no new trade , no trade carried on in any new channel , can afford a security equal to that which may be afforded by a trade carried on in any of the old ones : in whatever light the matter might appear to perfect intelligence , in the eye of every prudent person , exerting the best powers of judging which the fallible condition of the human faculties affords , the novelty of any commercial adventure will oppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could attend the same , or any other , adventure , already tried , and proved to be profitable by experience . The limitation of the profit that is to be made , by lending money to persons embarked in trade , will render the monied man more anxious , you may say , about the goodness of his security , and accordingly more anxious to satisfy himself respecting the prudence of a project in the carrying on of which the money is to be employed , than he would be otherwise : and in this way it may be thought that these laws have a tendency to pick out the good projects from the bad , and favour the former at the expence of the latter . The first of these positions I admit : but I can never admit the consequence to follow . A prudent man , ( I mean nothing more than a man of ordinary prudence ) a prudent man acting under the sole governance of prudential motives , I still say will not , in these circumstances , pick out the good projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects at all . He will pick out old-established trades from all sorts of projects , good and bad ; for with a new project , be it ever so promisiug , he never will have any thing to do . By every man that has money , five per cent . or whatever be the highest legal rate , is at all times , and always will be , to be had upon the very best security , that the best and most prosperous old-established trade can afford . Traders in general , I believe , it is commonly understood , are well enough inclined to enlarge their capital , as far as all the money they can borrow at the highest legal rate , while that rate is so low as 5 per cent. , will enlarge it . How it is possible therefore for a project , be it ever so promising , to afford , to a lender at any such rate of interest , terms equally advantageous , upon the whole , with those he might be sure of obtaining from an old-established business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may certainly chance , now and then , to find their way into the pockets of projectors as well as of other men : but when this happens it must be through incautiousness , or friendship , or the expectation of some collateral benefit , and not through any idea of the advantageousness of the transaction , in the light of a pecuniary bargain . I should not expect to see it alledged. that there is any thing , that should render the number of well-grounded projects , in comparison of the ill-grounded , less in time future , than it has been in time past . I am sure at least that I know of no reasons why it should be so , though I know of some reasons , which I shall beg leave to submit to you by and by , which appear to me pretty good ones , why the advantage should be on the side of futurity . But , unless the stock of well-grounded projects is already spent , and the whole stock of ill-grounded projects that ever were possible , are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censure you have passed on projectors , measuring still the extent of it by that of the operation of the laws in the defence of which it is employed , looks as far backward as forward : it condemns as rash and ill-grounded , all those projects : by which our species have been successively advanced from that state in which acorns were their food , and raw hides their cloathing , to the state in which it stands at present : for think , Sir , let me beg of you , whether whatever is now the routine of trade was not , at its commencement , project ? whether whatever is now establishment , was not , at one time , innovation ? How it is that the tribe of well-grounded projects , and of prudent projectors ( if by this time I may have your leave for applying this epithet to some at least among the projectors of time past ) , have managed to struggle through the obstacles which the laws in question have been holding in their way , it is neither easy to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , it must be by this time , that difficulties , and those not inconsiderable ones , those laws must have been holding up , in the way of projects of all sorts , of improvement ( if I may say so ) in every line , so long as they have had existence : reasonable therefore it must be to conclude , that , had it not been for these discouragements , projects of all sorts , well-grounded and successful ones , as well as others , would have been more numerous than they have been : and that accordingly , on the other hand , as soon , if ever , as these discouragements shall be removed , projects of all sorts , and among the rest , well-grounded and successful ones , will be more numerous than they would otherwise have been : in short , that , as , without these discouragements , the progress of mankind in the career of prosperity , would have been greater than it has been under them in time past , so , were they to be removed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That I have done you no injustice , in assigning to your idea of projectors so great a latitude , and that the unfavourable opinion you have professed to entertain of them is not confined to the above passage , might be made , I think , pretty apparent , if it be material , by another passage in the tenth chapter of your first book. ( 27* ) " The establishment of any new manufacture , of any new branch of commerce , or of any new practice in agriculture , " all these you comprehend by name under the list of " projects " : of every one of them you observe , that " it is a speculation from which the projector promises himself extraordinary profits . These profits ( you add ) are sometimes very great , and sometimes , more frequently perhaps , they are quite otherwise . but in general they bear no regular proportion to those of other old trades in the neighbourhood . If the project succeeds , they are commonly at first very high . When the trade or practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the level of other trades . " But on this head I forbear to insist : nor should I have taken this liberty of giving you back your own words , but in the hope of seeing some alteration made in them in your next edition , should I be fortunate enough to find my sentiments confirmed by your 's . In other respects , what is essential to the publick , is , what the error is in the sentiments entertained , not who it is that entertains them . I know not whether the observations which I have been troubling you with , will be thought to need , or whether they will be thought to receive , any additional support from those comfortable positions , of which you have made such good and such frequent use , concerning the constant tendency of mankind to get forward in the career of prosperity , the prevalence of prudence over imprudence , in the sum of private conduct at least , and the superior fitness of individuals for managing their own pecuniary concerns , of which they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislator , who can have no such knowledge . I will make the experiment : for , so long as I have the mortification to see you on the opposite side , I can never think the ground I have taken strong enough , while any thing remains that appears capable of rendering it still stronger . " With regard to misconduct , the number of prudent and successful undertakings " ( you observe(28*) ) " is every where much greater than that of injudicious and unsuccessful ones . After all our complaints of the frequency of bankruptcies , the unhappy men who fall into this misfortune make but a very small part of the whole number engaged in trade , and all other sorts of business ; not much more perhaps than one in a thousand . " ' T is in support of this position that you appeal to history for the constant and uninterrupted progress of mankind , in our island at least , in the career of prosperity : calling upon any one who should entertain a doubt of the fact , to divide the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caesar 's visit down to the present : proposing for instance the respective aeras of the Restoration , the Accession of Elizabeth , that of Henry VII , the Norman Conquest , and the Heptarchy , and putting it to the sceptic to find out , if he can , among all these periods , any one at which the condition of the country was not more prosperous than at the period immediately preceding it ; spite of so many wars , and fires , and plagues , and all other public calamities , with which it has been at different times afflicted , whether by the hand of God , or by the misconduct of the sovereign . No very easy task , I believe : the fact is too manifest for the most jaundiced eye to escape seeing it : -- But what and whom are we to thank for it , but projects , and projectors ? " No , " I think I hear you saying , " I will not thank projectors for it , I will rather thank the laws , which by fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repressing the temerity of projectors , and preventing their imprudence from making those defalcations from the sum of national prosperity which it would not have failed to make , had it been left free . If , during all these periods , that adventurous race of men had been left at liberty by the laws to give full scope to their rash enterprizes , the increase of national prosperity during these periods might have afforded some ground for regarding them in a more favourable point of view . But the fact is , that their activity has had these laws to check it ; without which checks you must give me leave to suppose , that the current of prosperity , if not totally stopt , or turned the other way , would at any rate have been more or less retarded . Here then " ( you conclude ) " lies the difference between us : what you look upon as the cause of the increase about which we are both agreed , I look upon as an obstacle to it : and what you look upon as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of starting this as a sort of plea that might be urged by you , I ought , perhaps , rather to have mentioned it as what might be urged by some people in your place : for as I do not imagine your penetration would suffer you to rest satisfied with it , still less can I suppose that , if you were not , your candour would allow you to make use of it as if you were . To prevent your resting satisfied with it , the following considerations would I think be sufficient . In the first place , of the seven periods which you have pitched upon , as so many stages for the eye to rest at in viewing the progress of prosperity , it is only during the three last , that the country has had the benefit , if such we are to call it , of these laws : for it is to the reign of Henry VIII that we owe the first of them . Here a multitude of questions might be started : Whether the curbing of projectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whether the views of it were not wholly confined to the reducing the gains of that obnoxious and envied class of men , the moneylenders ? Whether projectors have been most abundant before that statute , or since that statute ? And whether the nation has suffered , as you might say-benefited , as I should say , most by them , upon the whole , during the former period or the latter ? All these discussions , and many more that might be started , I decline engaging in , as more likely to retard , than to forward , our coming to any agreement conceiling the main question . In the next place , I must here take the liberty of referring . you to the proof , which I think I have already given , of the proposition , that the restraints in question could never have had the effect , in any degree , of lessening the proportion of bad projects to good ones , but only of diminishing , as far as their influence may have extended , the total number of projects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general tendency of the projecting spirit previously to the first of these laws , such it must have remained ever since , for any effect which they could have had in purifying and correcting it . But what may appear more satisfactory perhaps than both the above considerations , and may afford us the best help towards extricating ourselves from the perplexity , which the plea I have been combating ( and which I thought it necessary to bring to view , as the best that could be urged ) seems much better calculated to plunge us into , than bring us out of , is , the consideration of the small effect which the greatest waste that can be conceived to have been made within any compass of time , by injudicious projects , can have had on the sum of prosperity , even in the estimation of those whose opinion is most unfavourable to projectors , in comparison of the effect which within the same compass of time must have been produced by prodigality . Of the two causes , and only two causes , which you mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as the conduct of individuals is concerned , projecting , as I observed before , is the one , and prodigality is the other : but the detriment , which society can receive even from the concurrent efficacy of both these causes , you represent , on several occasions , as inconsiderable ; and , if I do not misapprehend you , too inconsiderable , either to need , or to warrant , the interposition of government to oppose it . Be this as it may with regard to projecting and prodigality taken together , with regard to prodigality at least , I am certain I do not misapprehend you . On this subject you ride triumphant , and chastise the " impertinence and presumption of kings and ministers , " with a tone of authority , which it required a courage like your 's to venture upon , and a genius like your 's to warrant a man to assume. ( 29* ) After drawing the parallel between private thrift and public profusion , " It is " ( you conclude ) " the highest impertinence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch over the economy of private people , and to restrain their expence , either by sumptuary laws , or by prohibiting the importation of foreign luxuries . They are themselves always , and without exception , the greatest spendthrifts in the society . let them look well after their own expence , and they may safely trust private people with theirs . If their own extravagance does not ruin the state , that of their subjects never will . " That the employing the expedients you mention for restraining prodigality , is indeed generally , perhaps even without exception , improper , and in many cases even ridiculous , I agree with you ; nor will I here step aside from my subject to defend from that imputation another mode suggested in a former part of these papers . But however presumptuous and impertinent it may be for the sovereign to attempt in any way to check by legal restraints the prodigality of individuals , to attempt to check their bad management by such restraints seems abundantly more so . To err in the way of prodigality is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many men , in comparison of the whole mass of mankind , yet at least of any man : the stuff fit to make a prodigal of is to be found in every alehouse , and under every hedge . But even to err in the way of projecting is the lot only of the privileged few . Prodigality , though not so common as to make any very material drain from the general mass of wealth , is however too common to be regarded as a mark of distinction or as a singularity . But the stepping aside from any of the beaten paths of traffic , is regarded as a singularity , as serving to distinguish a man from other men . Even where it requires no genius , no peculiarity of talent , as where it consists in nothing more than the finding out a new market to buy or sell in , it requires however at least a degree of courage , which is not to be found in the common herd of men . What shall we say of it , where , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rare endowment of genius , as in the instance of all those successive enterprizes by which arts and manufactures have been brought from their original nothing to their present splendor ? Think how small a part of the community these must make , in comparison of the race of prodigals ; of that very race , which , were it only on account of the smallness of its number , would appear too inconsiderable to you to deserve attention . Yet prodigality is essentially and necessarily hurtful , as far as it goes , to the opulence of the state : projecting , only by accident . Every prodigal , without exception , impairs , by the very supposition impairs , if he does not annihilate , his fortune . But it certainly is not every projector that impairs his : it is not every projector that would have done so , had there been none of those wise laws to hinder him : for the fabric of national opulence , that fabric of which you proclaim , with so generous an exultation , the continual increase , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , it required the reprobated hand of a projector to lay the first stone , has required some hands at least to be employed , and successfully employed . When in comparison of the number of prodigals , which is too inconsiderable to deserve notice , the number of projectors of all kinds is so much more inconsiderable-and when from this inconsiderable number , must be deducted , the not inconsiderable proportion of successful projectors -- and from this remainder again , all those who can carry on their projects without need of borrowing -- think whether it be possible , that this last remainder could afford a multitude , the reducing of which would be an object , deserving the interposition of government by its magnitude , even taking for granted that it were an object proper in its nature ? If it be still a question , whether it be worth while for government , by its reason , to attempt to controul the conduct of men visibly and undeniably under the dominion of passion , and acting , under that dominion , contrary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect what is acknowledged to be their better judgment , against what every body , even themselves , would acknowledge to be their worse ; is it endurable that the legislator should by violence substitute his own pretended reason , the result of a momentary and scornful glance , the offspring of wantonness and arrogance , much rather than of social anxiety and study , in the place of the humble reason of individuals , binding itself down with all its force to that very object which he pretends to have in view ? -- Nor let it be forgotten , that , on the side of the individual in this strange competition , there is the most perfect and minute knowledge and information , which interest , the whole interest of a man 's reputation and fortune , can ensure : on the side of the legislator , the most perfect ignorance . All that he knows , all that he can know , is , that the enterprize is a project , which , merely because it is susceptible of that obnoxious name , he looks upon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wantonness , to shie at . -- Shall the blind lead the blind ? is a question that has been put of old to indicate the height of folly : but what then shall we say of him who , being necessarily blind , insists on leading , in paths he never trod in , those who can see ? It must be by some distinction too fine for my conception , if you clear yourself from the having taken , on another occasion , but on the very point in question , the side , on which it would be my ambition to see you fix . " What is the species of domestic industry which his capital can employ , and of which the produce is likely to be of the greatest value , every individual " ( you say(30*) ) , " it is evident , can , in his local situation , judge much better than any statesman or lawgiver can do for him . The statesman , who should attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but assume an authority which could safely be trusted , not only to no single person , but to no council or senate whatsoever , and which would no where be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it . " To give the monopoly of the home market to the produce of domestic industry , in any particular art or manufacture , is in some measure to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals , and must in almost all cases be either a useless or a hurtful regulation . " -- Thus far you : and I add , to limit the legal interest to a rate at which the carriers on of the oldest and best established and least hazardous trades are always glad to borrow , is to give the monopoly of the money-market to those traders , as against the projectors of new-imagined trades , not one of which but , were it only from the circumstance of its novelty , must , as I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These , in comparison , are but inconclusive topics . I touched upon them merely as affording , what appeared to me the only shadow of a plea , that could be brought , in defence of the policy I am contending against . I come back therefore to my first ground , and beg you once more to consider , whether , of all that host of manufactures , which we both exult in as the causes and ingredients of national prosperity , there be a single one , that could have existed at first but in the shape of a project . But , if a regulation , the tendency and effect of which is merely to check projects , in as far as they are projects , without any sort of tendency , as I have shewn , to weed out the bad ones , is defensible in its present state of imperfect efficacy , it should not only have been defensible , but much more worthy of our approbation , could the efficacy of it have been so far strengthened and compleated as to have opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of projects whatsoever : that is to say , if , stretching forth its hand over the first rudiments of society , it had confined us , from the beginning . to mud for our habitations , to skins for our cloathing , and to acorns for our food . I hope you may by this time be disposed to allow me , that we have not been ill served by the projects of time past . I have already intimated , that I could not see any reason why we should apprehend our being worse served by the projects of time future . I will now venture to add , that I think I do see reason , why we should expect to be still better and better served by these projects , than by those . I mean better upon the whole , in virtue of the reduction which experience , if experience be worth any thing , should make in the proportion of the number of the ill-grounded and unsuccessful , to that of the well-grounded and successful ones . The career of art , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered as a vast , and perhaps unbounded , plain , bestrewed with gulphs , such as Curtius was swallowed up in . Each requires an human victim to fall into it ere it can close , but when it once closes , it closes to open no more , and so much of the path is safe to those who follow . If the want of perfect information of former miscarriages renders the reality of human life less happy than this picture , still the similitude must be acknowledged : and we see at once the only plain and effectual method for bringing that similitude still nearer and nearer to perfection ; I mean , the framing the history of the projects of time past , and ( what may be executed in much greater perfection were but a finger held up by the hand of government ) the making provision for recording , and collecting and publishing as they are brought forth , the race of those with which the womb of futurity is still pregnant . But to pursue this idea , the execution of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from the purpose . Comfortable it is to reflect , that this state of continually-improving security , is the natural state not only of the road to opulence , but of every other track of human life . In the war which industry and ingenuity maintain with fortune , past ages of ignorance and barbarism form the forlorn hope , which has been detached in advance , and made a sacrifice of for the sake of future . The golden age , it is but too true , is not the lot of the generation in which we live : but , if it is to be found in any part of the track marked out for human existence , it will be found , I trust , not in any part which is past , but in some part which is to come . But to return to the laws against usury , and their restraining influence on projectors . I have made it , I hope , pretty apparent , that these restraints have no power or tendency to pick out bad projects from the good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may do with some truth , that the tendency of them is rather to pick the good out from the bad ? Thus much at least may be said , and it comes to the same thing , that there is one case in which , be the project what it may , they may have the effect of checking it , and another in which they can have no such effect , and that the first has for its accompaniment , and that a necessary one , a circumstance which has a strong tendency to separate and discard every project of the injudicious stamp , but which is wanting in the other case . I mean , in a word , the benefit of discussion . It is evident enough , that upon all such projects , whatever be their nature , as find funds sufficient to carry them on , in the hands of him whose invention gave them birth , these laws are perfectly , and if by this time you will allow me to say so , very happily , without power . But for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to experience , than the inventor 's own partial affection . It is not only not necessary that they should have had , but it is natural enough that they should not have had , any such judge : since in most cases the advantage to be expected from the project depends upon the exclusive property in it , and consequently upon the concealment of the principle . Think , on the other hand , how different is the lot of that enterprize which depends upon the good opinion of another man , that other , a man possessed of the wealth which the projector wants , and before whom necessity forces him to appear in the character of a suppliant at least : happy if , in the imagination of his judge , he adds not to that degrading character , that of a visionary enthusiast or an impostor ! At any rate , there are , in this case , two wits , set to sift into the merits of the project , for one , which was employed upon that same task in the other case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices are certainly not most likely to be on the favourable side . True it is , that in the jumble of occurrences , an over-sanguine projector may stumble upon a patron as over-sanguine as himself ; and the wishes may bribe the judgment of the one , as they did of the other . The opposite case , however , you will allow , I think , to be by much the more natural . Whatever a man 's wishes may be for the success of an enterprize not yet his own , his fears are likely to be still stronger . That same pretty generally implanted principle of vanity and self-conceit , which disposes most of us to over-value each of us his own conceptions , disposes us , in a proportionable degree , to undervalue those of other men . Is it worth adding , though it be undeniably true , that could it even be proved , by ever so uncontrovertible evidence , that , from the beginning of time to the present day , there never was a project that did not terminate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact as this could the legislator derive any sufficient warrant , so much as for wishing to see the spirit of projects in any degree repressed ? The discouraging motto , Sic vos non vobis , may be matter of serious consideration to the individual , but what is it to the legislator ? What general , let him attack with ever so superior an army , but knows that hundreds , or perhaps thousands , must perish at the first onset ? Shall he , for that consideration alone , lie inactive in his lines ? " Every man for himself -- but God , " adds the proverb ( and it might have added the general , and the legislator , and all other public servants ) , " for us all . " Those sacrifices of individual to general welfare , which , on so many occasions , are made by third persons against men 's wills , shall the parties themselves be restrained from making , when they do it of their own choice ? To tie men neck and heels , and throw them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the question : but if at every gulph a Curtius stands mounted and caparisoned , ready to take the leap , is it for the legislator , in a fit of old-womanish tenderness , to pull him away ? laying even public interest out of the question , and considering nothing but the feelings of the individuals immediately concerned , a legislator would scarcely do so , who knew the value of hope , " the most precious gift of heaven . " Consider , Sir , that it is not with the invention-lottery ( that great branch of the project-lottery , for the sake of which I am defending the whole , and must continue so to do until you or somebody else can shew me how to defend it on better terms ) , it is not I say with the invention-lottery , as with the mine-lottery , the privateering-lottery , and so many other lotteries , which you speak of , and in no. instance , I think , very much to their advantage . In these lines , success does not , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thence propagate itself , by a happy contagion , perhaps to all eternity . let Titius have found a mine , it is not the more easy , but by so much the less easy , for Sempronius to find one too : let Titius have made a capture , it is not the more easy , but by so much the less easy , for Sempronius to do the like . But let Titius have found out a new dye , more brilliant or more durable than those in use , let him have invented a new and more convenient machine , or a new and more profitable mode of husbandry , a thousand dyers , ten thousand mechanics , a hundred thousand husbandmen , may repeat and multiply his success : and then , what is it to the public , though the fortune of Titius , or of his usurer. should have sunk under the experiment ? Birmingham and Sheffield are pitched upon by you as examples , the one of a projecting town , the other of an unprojecting one. ( 31* ) Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison of your own chosing , did not suggest some suspicions of the justice of the conceptions you had taken up , to the disadvantage of projectors . Sheffield is an old oak : Birmingham , but a mushroom . What if we should find the mushroom still vaster and more vigorous than the oak ? Not but the one as well as the other , at what time soever planted , must equally have been planted by projectors : for though Tubal Cain himself were to be brought post from Armenia to plant Sheffield , Tubal Cain himself was as arrant a projector in his day , as ever Sir Thomas Lombe was , or Bishop Blaise : but Birmingham , it seems , claims in common parlance the title of a projecting town , to the exclusion of the other , because , being but of yesterday , the spirit of project smells fresher and stronger there than elsewhere . When the odious sound of the word projector no longer tingles in your ears , the race of men thus stigmatized do not always find you their enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expensive experiments , " are represented as not unfit to be encouraged , even though monopoly be the means : and the monopoly is defended in that instance , by its similarity to other instances in which the like means are employed to the like purpose . " When a company of merchants undertake at their own risk and expence to establish a new trade , with some remote and barbarous nation , it may not be unreasonable " ( you observe ) " to incorporate them into a joint-stock company , and to grant them , in case of their success , a monopoly of the trade for a certain number of years . It is the easiest and most natural way , in which the state can recompense them , for hazarding a dangerous and expensive experiment , of which the public is afterwards to reap the benefit . A temporary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated , upon the same principles , upon which a like monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor , and that of a new book to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing this occasion of giving a warning , which is so much needed by mankind . If so original and independent a spirit has not been always able to save itself from being drawn aside by the fascination of sounds , into the paths of vulgar prejudice , how strict a watch ought not men of common mould to set over their judgments , to save themselves from being led astray by similar delusions ? I have sometimes been tempted to think , that were it in the power of laws to put words under proscription , as it is to put men , the cause of inventive industry might perhaps derive scarcely less assistance from a bill of attainder against the words project and Projectors , than it has derived from the act authorizing the grant of patents . I should add , however , for a time : for even then the envy , and vanity , and wounded pride , of the uningenious herd , would sooner or later infuse their venom into some other word , and set it up as a new tyrant , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infant genius , and crush it in its cradle . Will not you accuse me of pushing malice beyond all bounds , if I bring down against you so numerous and respectable a body of men , as the members of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts ? I do not , must not , care : for you command too much respect to have any claim to mercy . At least you will not accuse me of spiriting up against you barbarian enemies , and devoting you to the vengeance of Cherokees and Chicasaws . Of that popular institution , the very professed and capital object is the encouragement of projects , and the propagating of that obnoxious breed , the crushing of which you commend as a fit exercise for the arm of power . But if it be right to crush the acting malefactors , it would be downright inconsistency not to crush , at the same time , or rather not to begin with crushing , these their hirers and abettors . Thank then their inadvertence , or their generosity , or their prudence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ceremony , as a libel on the society , a book that does honour to the age . After having had the boldness to accuse so great a master of having fallen unawares into an error , may I take the still farther liberty , of setting conjecture to work to account for it ? Scarce any man , perhaps no man , can push the work of creation , in any line , to such a pitch of compleatness , as to have gone through the task of examining with his own eyes into the grounds of every position , without exception , which he has had occasion to employ . You heard the public voice , strengthened by that of law , proclaiming all round you , that usury was a sad thing , and usurers a wicked and pernicious set of men : you heard from one at least of those quarters , that projectors were either a foolish and contemptible race , or a knavish and destructive one : hurried away by the throng , and taking very naturally for granted , that what every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have joined the cry , and added your suffrage to the rest . Possibly too , among the crowd of projectors which the lottery of occurrences happened to present to your observation , the prejudicial sort may have borne such a proportion to the beneficial , or shewn themselves in so much stronger colours , as to have given the popular notion a firmer hold in your judgment , than it would have had , had the contrary proportion happened to present itself to your notice . To allow no more weight to examples that fall close under our eyes , than to those which have fallen at ever so great a distance -- to suffer the judgment on no occasion to indulge itself in the licence of a too hasty and extensive generalisation -- not to give any proposition footing there , rill after all such defalcations have been made , as are necessary to reduce it within the limits of rigid truth -- these are laws , the compleat observance whereof forms the ultimate , and hitherto , perhaps for ever , ideal term of human wisdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one innocent at least , the other highly useful ; the spreaders of English arts in foreign climes , ( 32* ) and those whose industry exerts itself in distributing that necessary commodity which is called by the way of eminence the staff of life . May I flatter myself with having succeeded at last in my endeavours , to recommend to the same powerful protection , two other highly useful and equally persecuted sets of men , usurers and projectors. -- Yes -- I will , for the moment at least , indulge so flattering an idea : and , in pursuance of it , leaving usurers , for whom I have said enough already , I will consider myself as joined now with you in the same commission , and thinking with you of the best means of relieving the projector from the load of discouragement laid on him by these laws , in so far as the pressure of them falls particularly upon him . In my own view of the matter , indeed , no temperament , no middle course , is either necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only perfectly proper remedy , -- a spunge . But , as nothing is more common with mankind , than to give opposite receptions , to conclusions flowing with equal necessity from the same principle , let us accommodate our views to that contingency . According to this idea , the object , as far as confined to the present case , should be , to provide , in favour of projectors only , a dispensation from the rigour of the anti-usurious laws : such , for instance , as is enjoyed by persons engaged in the carrying trade , in virtue of the indulgence given to loans made on the footing of respondentia or bottomry . As to abuse , I see not why the danger of it should be greater in this case than in those . Whether a sum of money be embarked , or not embarked , in such or such a new manufacture on land , should not , in its own nature , be a fact much more difficult to ascertain , than whether it be embarked , or not embarked , in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the one case as in the other , the payment of the interest , as well as the repayment of the principal , might be made to depend upon the success of the adventure . To confine the indulgence to new undertakings , the having obtained a patent for some invention , and the continuance of the term of the patent , might be made conditions of the allowance given to the bargain : to this might be added affidavits , expressive of the intended application , and bonds , with sureties , conditioned for the performance of the intention so declared ; to be registered in one of the patent-offices or elsewhere . After this , affidavits once a year , or oftener , during the subsistence of the contract , declaring what has been done in execution of it . If the leading-string is not yet thought tight enough , boards of controul might be instituted to draw it tighter . Then opens a scene of vexation and intrigue : waste of time consumed in courting the favour of the members of the board : waste of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance , at any rate by disdain , and self-sufficiency , and vanity , and pride : the favour ( for pride will make it a favour ) granted to skill in the arts of self-recommendation and cabal , devoid of inventive merit , and refused to naked merit unadorned by practice in those arts : waste of time on the part of the persons themselves engaged in this impertinent inquiry : waste of somebody 's money in paying them for this waste of time . All these may be necessary evils , where the money to be bestowed is public money : how idle where it is the party 's own ! I will not plague you , nor myself , with enquiring of whom shall be composed this board of nurses to grown gentlemen : were it only to cut the matter short , one might name at once the committees of the Society of Arts . There you have a body of men ready trained in the conduct of enquiries , which resemble that in question , in every circumstance , but that which renders it ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as likely , I take it , to discharge such a trust with fidelity and skill , as any aristocracy that could be substituted in their room . Crichoff , in White Russia , March 1787 . To Dr Smith A little tract of mine , in the latter part of which I took the liberty of making use of your name , ( the Defence of Usury ) , having been some time out of print , I am about publishing a new edition of it . I am now therefore at a period at which , if I have done you or any body any injustice , I shall have the opportunity , and assuredly I do not want the inclination , to repair it : or if in any other respect I have fallen into an error , I could give myself and the public the benefit of its being set right . I have been Battered with the intelligence that , upon the whole , your sentiments with respect to the points of difference are at present the same as mine : but as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communication of it received the sanction of your authority , I shall not without that action give any hint , honourable as it would be to me , and great as the service is which it could not but render to my cause . I have been favoured with the communication from Dr Reid of Glasgow of an inedited paper of his on the same subject , written a good many years ago . He declares himself now fully of my opinion on the question of expediency , and had gone a considerable length towards it at that time . The only ground on which he differs from me , is that of the origination of the prejudice , of which his paper gives , as might be expected , an account more ecclesiastical than mine . Anxious to do my cause as much service as it is capable of receiving , I write to him now , to endeavour to persuade him to give his paper to the world , or if he looks upon so much of it as concerns the question of utility as superseded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- that part which he prefers to mine -- to some general repository for short publications , or allow me the honour of forwarding it to the world in company with mine . The account that has been given by the Marquis de Condorcet of the sentiments of Turgot on the same subject , is already every body 's without leave : I shall accordingly annex , by way of appendix to my new edition , the original as well as a translation of that short passage . I am the more anxious to collect all the force I can muster , in as far as I find from the printed debates , as well as from private intelligence , that the project of reducing the rate of interest in Ireland is not yet given up : though this perseverance is hardly reconciliable with the account I receive from the same quarter , of the impression made in that country by the Defence of Usury . Yet the subjecting the rate of interest to a further reduction by a new law , is a much more mischievous and less defensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footing : and adds to the mischief of the old established regimen others of a new and much more serious nature . It would be a tax upon the owners of money , much heavier than ever was levied upon the proprietors of land : with this circumstance to distinguish it from all other taxes , that , instead of being brought into the treasury for the public service , it is made a present of to the collectors , in expectation of the good they are to do the nation by the spending of it . If this be good thrift , in the name of consistency and equality let them impose a land Tax to the same amount , and dispose of the produce in the same manner . What makes my anxiety the greater , is the uncertainty whether this project of plunder without profit may not be still hovering over this island . Last year it was roundly and positively asserted in the Irish House of Commons , as if upon personal knowledge , to he determined upon in the Cabinet here : and the Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge , would no contradict it . Its suspension hitherto may have resulted from nothing more than a doubt whether the nation were yet ripe , according to the Irish phrase , for this mode of enrichment : as if there were a time at which a nation were riper for plunder and waste than at another . I am truly sorry I can not find time to make one effort more for the express purpose of stemming the torrent of delusion in that channel . The straw I have planted has done something : what might not be hoped for , if your oak-stick were linked with it ? As the world judges , one upon examination and nine hundred and ninety-nine upon trust , the declaration of your opinion upon any point of legislation would be worth , I wo n't pretend to say how many votes : but the declaration of your opinion in favour of a side to which conviction and candour had brought you over from the opposite one , would be worth at least twice or thrice as many : under such circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison of that of the proselyte , especially such a proselyte . We should have the Irish Chancellor of the Exchequer abjuring his annual motion in the face of the House , and Lord Hawkesbury who , it has been said , is Mr Pitt 's tutor in this wise business , quietly and silently putting his papers and calculations into the fire . If , then , you agree with me in looking upon this as a most pernicious measure , you would , like me , be glad to see it put an end to , and for that purpose the acknowledgement of your opinion on a subject which you have made so much and so honourably your own , is an expedient to the use of which , I should hope , you would not see any objection : the less as you would hardly , I suppose , let another edition of your great work go abroad with opinions in it that were yours no longer . If , then , you think proper to honour me with your allowance for that purpose , then and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in such words as you give me , that you no longer look upon the rate of interest as fit subject for restraint : and then , thanks to you and Turgot and Dr Reid , the Defence of Usury may be pronounced , in its outworks at least , a strong-hold . PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION When the first edition of these letters was published , I was still in the distant country from which they were written . It is about two years , since that impression was exhausted : it is about a year and a half since this reimpression was compleated , the publication having been retarded till now by causes not worth mentioning . The alterations made in this second edition are few , and those merely verbal and of no importance . In this interval , had I heard of any objection , total or partial , I would have either admitted the force of it , or answered it : but I have not been able to meet with any . I have scarce heard of a reader who has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the laws against usury , together with those others that are here pointed out as depending on the same principle . That matters are at all the nearer to such a measure since the publication of this work than they were before , is more than I can pretend to have any ground for supposing : for in great political questions , wide indeed is the distance between conviction and practice . An intelligent Frenchman , of whom I have not been able to learn enough to distinguish him more particularly , published a few months since a translation he had made for his own amusement , a considerable time before the commencement of the Revolution , he says , not long after the work found its way to France . He kept back the translation , thinking the country not ripe for it . The general slaughter that has been made of all sorts of prejudices in that country may now , he thinks , have opened the way for it . But if its turning to any account in practice depends upon the overthrow of prejudice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be expected from it here ? It is to the attempt made in Ireland to effect a fresh forced reduction of the legal rate of interest in that country , that the reimpression there published must naturally have been indebted for a circulation proportionably more extensive than here . Between that measure and the laws condemned by this investigation , the connection is close and evident . Had the reduction so proposed been naturally productive of the advantage expected from it , and at the same time not attended with any additional hardship or other inconvenience superior to that advantage , such a reduction would then have had no other objections to combat than the objections , decisive as they are represented in this work , which apply to the original fixation . According to my conception of the matter , however , that advantage is altogether illusory ; the measure is attended with hardships much more than sufficient to outweigh the advantage , were it real , and of these , several are distinct from , and superadded to , those which result from the impropriety of ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the politico-economical advantage proposed from this ulterior and fresh reduction , I should have set it down among the reasons capable of being alledged in support of the original fixation : for the advantage , if it were one , of the proposed future reduction , must proportionably have resulted from the precedent ones . The fact is , I must confess , that in the situation I was then in , sequestered not less from political converse than from books , this supposed advantage had equally escaped my recollection and my imagination as applicable to the original fixation , though recollection had represented it as capable of having been supposed to result from successive reductions . From newspapers I had learnt thus much , that in England a fresh reduction had lately been proposed , as tending some how or other to the benefit of trade : but the sound of the word trade being all I was able to collect , what that benefit was , or how it was to be brought about , was more than I could conceive . To apply it to the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have some conception of the force of it : and unfortunately I was unable to perceive any force or meaning in it at all . It had equally escaped Dr Smith : for his reasons in support of the limitation of the rate of interest are confined to the discouragement of prodigals and projectors : of any supposed benefit to trade that was to follow from it in any other way , he betrays not the smallest suspicion : and blindness may be confessed without much shame , where eyes like Dr Smith 's have failed to see . I little suspected , I must confess , that so many intelligent and ingenious men would so compleatly have mistaken a consequence for a cause . Instructed by the debates of the Irish Parliament . I now understand clearly what benefit was expected from it , but how that benefit was to flow from it is as much a mystery to me as ever . I will however avail myself now of that intelligence . By way of postscript , I have accordingly given a very short , but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that supposed benefit to my system : and being thereby engaged to touch upon the measure of an ulterior reduction by which this supposed advantage was brought to view , I have stated such other considerations a appear to combat the propriety of that ulterior reduction , though not all of them applicable to the continuing of the rate at its present level . As little can I pretend to say , whether a project of the same nature bas received any check from it in England . Infallibility is among the appendages of power : and if it be a dream , it is one of those which do not own themselves as such , and from which men are seldom thankful for being awaked . Several circumstances render probable that a project of this sort was not very long ago entertained : a positive assertion to that effect made in the Irish Parliament received no contradiction . Of late , nothing has been heard of it . The notion perhaps may be , that the country is not yet ripe for it . My notion is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not pretend here to exhaust the subject , or to urge all that can be urged against the measure : nor to trace out to the last link the whole chain of its consequences . Such an undertaking would require more paper perhaps than it is worth , at any rate more time than at present I can spare . All I pretend to is to give what shall be sufficient to demonstrate its impolicy and injustice . The propositions here given as conclusions from the decisive principle are , most of them , maintained by Dr Smith . The proposition here given as a principle itself is also laid down in the same admirable work : but without emphasis , and for any direct use that has been made of it , it might as well have not been there . Wide is the difference between a full view of a principle and a side glance . The principle which forms the basis of Locke 's Essay is to be found , in so many words , in Aristotle : yet what was the world the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , till Locke put it out to use ? This same principle is also to be found , stated still more pointedly , in Lord Sheffield 's elaborate and useful work . Yet what came of it ? The whole work is full of advice as repugnant to that principle as it is to the doctrines of Dr Smith 's book : that very book which his Lordship quotes in those terms of respect which is its due , for the sake of stating almost the only doctrine in which the authority is in his favour , passing by the whole of what is against him , that is almost the whole contents of the book , as if they had not been there . Colonies . Dr. Smith observes that , by the expence they have produced instead of revenue , they have been always hitherto worth so much less than nothing , and by the expence of wars waged for them , a hundred and so many millions less than nothing . What is his practical inference ? that they should be given up ? no : but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yield a revenue , which is impossible . The idea of giving them up is started -- but how ? as the extremity of misfortune , the horrors of which should drive us into schemes for making them yield a revenue , as the only alternative common sense admitts of . We are to give them up : how ? with the same emotions of regret , with which a man who found a necessity of retrenching , would lay down his equipage . The separation would be a misfortune not to us only , but to them . Why to them ? because nothing but our superior wisdom and virtue could prevent their falling together by the ears . The event has not been favourable to this prophecy . Among these rebels , every thing breathes content and unanimity . Ill will there never has been : and the last spark of so much as a difference of opinion , patience has now finally extinguished . In the principal of our still loyal colonies , whose petitions for these six years we have not been able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is just . May it be effectual ! POSTSCRIPT SHORT OBSERVATIONS ON THE INJUSTICE AND IMPOLICY OF FORCED REDUCTIONS OF THE RATE OF INTEREST Since the writing of the preceding Letters , I have heard of some other advantages supposed to result from the limitation of the rate of interest which , I must confess , had not then occurred to me as resulting from the restraints thus laid on the liberty of contracting . These are 1 . Encreasing the sum of national wealth . 2 . Enabling the state to take and to keep money at interest upon more advantageous terms than it could otherwise , and thus diminishing the sum of the public burthens which are the deductions from national wealth , encreasing therefore in this negative way the clear sum of national wealth upon the whole . Examine into these supposed advantages , you will find them both altogether illusory , and that , did they not only exist , but exist in the utmost degree that was ever attributed to them , they could not be obtained but at the expence of inconveniences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in point of fact : such a limitation has scarce any perceptible tendency in any way whatever to add to the mass of national wealth , and it tends in a variety of ways to diminish it . As to the second , neither does that exist in the shape of an advantage . The public may or may not hold money of individuals at interest upon more advantageous terms , but from this circumstance the mass of national wealth is not rendered a jot more considerable than it would be otherwise . At no time , therefore , does the nation , collectively considered , derive any advantage from this limitation : and as often as any fresh imitation is applied whereby the restraint is drawn tighter , the nation suffers the inconvenience of an unequal and very heavy tax . without reaping the advantages that it does from other taxes . First supposed advantage -- Encreasing in a direct way the mass of national wealth in the hands of individuals . This advantage , I say , will not be found to result in any degree from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth , is the result of labour employed by the help of capital , the result of preceding labour . No accession to wealth in any hands , public or private , can take place but in one or other of two ways : 1 . By the augmentation of the mass of capital employed in giving motion to industry : 2 . By a more advantageous application of the existing stock of capital , its application in a more advantageous manner . That the measure in question can contribute in the latter of these two modes to the encrease of wealth , has never been , nor ever will be supposed . On the other hand I have already shewn that it has a contrary effect . Every more advantageous mode than was before known of applying a part of the quantity of capital in hand is , previously to trial and success , a Project : and the effect of this limitation in discouraging projects has already been displayed . 2 . It has no particular tendency to encrease the quantity of capital . It has , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain manner the distribution of wealth among the different sharers : it is only in proportion as it has this tendency , that this or any other regulation relative to property can have any effect at all . It must also be admitted that , if in any degree it tends to augment the quantity of wealth employed in the shape of capital , with reference to , and at the expence of , that part which is employed in the shape of unproductive consumption and expenditure , it must in proportion operate in augmentation of the mass of capital employed as capital in the production of wealth , and thence of the growing stock of national wealth . Whoever saves money , as the phrase is , adds proportionably to the general mass of capital . There is scarce any description of people that does not include some individuals that save money : but some descriptions are likely to include more such frugal individuals than others . If the tendency of the measure in question be to throw or to keep money in the hands of persons of particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be of a frugal cast upon the whole than the descriptions of people at whose expence it is thus disposed of , the measure possesses in so far a tendency to produce the intended effect . But no such particular tendency is discoverable in it . The persons on whom it operates , belong to one or other of two classes , borrowers and lenders : its property is to favour the former at the expence of the latter . If of borrowers in general it could be said that they were more frugal than lenders , a favour shewn to borrowers as such would be a help given to frugality . But no such proposition thus taken in the lump can be received as true . Neither reason nor so much as prejudice plead in favour of it . Ask prejudice , the answer will be that , in comparison of borrowers , lenders are not only frugal , but frugal to such a degree as to be . avaricious . The supposition of their proneness to avarice is the very thing that excites prejudice against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all regulations , the tendency of which is to lay them under a disadvantage . It is because they are hoarders that they are to be discouraged -- to what end ? -- in order to encourage hoarding . Such is the consistency of blind and vulgar prejudice , hitherto in so many important points the arbiter of the destiny of nations . Setting prejudice aside , and taking reason for our guide , it is impossible to say whether the cause of frugality be prejudiced or served by the favour thus shewn to borrowers , untill it be specified for what purpose a man means to borrow . When a man borrows , it is either to spend or to accumulate . So far as it favours the dissipating class of borrowers , the measure directly counteracts this its proposed object : it adds , as far as it operates , to the amount of what they are enabled to employ in dissipation . It is not incumbent on those who take the side I take , to go about to prove a negative , viz. that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frugality than in the class of lenders . It is incumbent on those who take the side I combat , to establish the opposite affirmative proposition . Every restraint on liberty is so far an evil : and it lies on him who proposes any such restraint , to shew the greater good by which this evil is counterbalanced . This has never been attempted : nor , howsoever it may have been tacitly taken for granted , has it in any instance been directly and explicitly affirmed . Propositions diametrically opposite are both received with open arms , to justify the propensity to injure and oppress the class of lenders . At one time lenders are to be pinched , because borrowers are more likely to be spendthrifts than hoarders : at another time , because they are more likely to be hoarders than spendthrifts . Persons concerned in bargains of this kind may be distinguished into three classes : possessors of capital who risk to lend it , i.e. money lenders ; dissipating borrowers ; and accumulating borrowers . The restraint in question favours the two latter classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as it favours dissipating borrowers , it counteracts its avowed purpose , is manifest at any rate : does it promote that purpose in as far as it favours accumulating borrowers ? This can not so clearly be averred . It does so only in as far as the accumulating borrowers are greater accumulators than the persons of whom they borrow . Take an instance . The money that is borrowed by accumulators engaged in trade , of whom is it borrowed principally ? of persons who spend all their income ? No , but of other accumulators -- of other persons as great accumulators as themselves : of shopkeepers or wholesale dealers in the way of goods ordered on credit : or of bankers or merchants in the way of discount . And thus far , therefore , it is evident that accumulation is not more favoured by the restraint in one way , than it is checked in the other . In another way the restraint in question counteracts this part of its object in a more manifest and conspicuous manner : viz. by lessening the quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ augment its capital only in one way : viz. by parsimony . A nation may augment its capital , as an individual may augment his capital , in either of two ways : by saving , or by borrowing . By borrowing capital for the purpose of accumulation , is it likely to add to the stock of national wealth ? Yes : if the value of what is thereby produced is greater than the value of what is paid for interest : in that case the clear amount of the accumulation , the clear gain to the nation , is to the amount of the difference . But this it may always be reckoned , and that on two different accounts which concurr in encreasing the advantage : 1 . In the first place , the general rate of mercantile profit is greater every where than the rate of interest : it is in general at least double : 2 . In the next place , in manufactures(33*) the rate of profit encreases with the encrease of capital by the advantages derivable from the division of labour , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even labour in some cases serve for a larger quantity of work than would have been necessary for a smaller . It has already been shewn in the body of the work that the quantity of good success in all branches of industry taken together is much superior to the quantity of i 'll success : and this it is not less likely to be in the instances where a man aids his original by borrowed capital than in others . If a man engaged in industry did not expect to get more by the money he borrows than he pays for it , he would not borrow it : and it has been shewn that such expectations are much more frequently realised than frustrated . To seek to restrain industrious men from borrowing money under the apprehension of its not answering to them would be an additional instance , but an instance not more flagrant than those which are perpetually exhibited , of the ignorance and folly , and blindness , and vanity , and presumption , and despotism that hitherto have been endemial among legislators . Look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel with outlandish money , because it is outlandish , at least for the purpose of the argument . The popular notion that ill-gotten money does not thrive , howsoever hacknied by superstition , has not only a much better effect , but even a more rational ground . Two i 'll effects are attributed to outlandish money : 1st . That the interest paid for it is so much money sent out of the country . But were not the interest sent out of the country , the profit would not come into it . And profit , we have seen , ought to be estimated at more than double the value of the interest . The force of this argument depends upon the forgetting altogether the chapter of profit : and supposing that the money thus sent out of the country , is sent out for nothing . It is an argument that applies against selling any thing to foreigners : or indeed to any body on any terms . What are the particular courses taken by such imported money , whether for example it being laid out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sort of difference . If the money laid out by the Dutch in the English funds , that is , lent to the English government , had not been so disposed of , English money to the same amount must have lain there : there would therefore have been so much less English money to be applied in the support of English industry , in the encrease of the sum of the national wealth of England. ( 34* ) 2dly . That money borrowed of foreigners will be perpetually liable to be recalled . To render this an objection , two circumstances must concur . 1 . The foreign money must be more liable to be recalled than home money . 2 . When recalled , the prejudice resulting from the recall must be likely to be greater than all the advantage reaped before the recall . Neither of these propositions has ever been attempted to be proved : nor does either seem likely to be true . 1 . It may happen to any lender to recall his money : but this is not more likely to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may put cases where an Englishman who has lend his money in Ireland(35*) may be disposed to recall that money : but it is just as easy to put cases in which an Irishman who has lent his money in Ireland may be disposed to do the same thing . An Irishman who is upon the spot is more likely to look for , to spy out , and to improve such opportunities , than an Englishman who is at a distance , and who , if he lends his money in such a way , is more likely to have lent it with views of permanence , and as a means of providing himself for life , without farther sollicitude , a settled income . 2 . If there were any reason to apprehend that the time when the foreign lender may call in his money would be more inconvenient to the lender than the time when a home lender might call in his , the danger of recall might sooner afford an objection to the importation of foreign capital . But no such reason can be assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his money will not be governed by the consideration of the inconvenience to the borrower , but by the consideration of his own convenience . But that convenience is not the more likely to clash with the convenience of the borrower on account of the lender 's being a foreigner : not more likely to do so than that of a lender at home . We have seen that on one account it is less likely : because a foreign lender is less likely to be tempted by opportunities of occasional profit to clasp and change his security than a native . It is also on another account : a lender at home is more in the way of being acquainted with the circumstances and exigencies of his borrower .. more in the way of having quarrels with him : of watching opportunities of distressing him in a time of need , either for the sake of hurting him , or for the sake of making a profit of his distress . Whatever may , by accident , be the disadvantage resulting to A or B in this way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported will , so long as it continues unrecalled , be productive to the nation that has imported it , of a clear revenue to the amount just stated . If the use of a million for ten years would have been worth 600,000 , the use of the same million for one year will have been 60,000 . Recall it when you will , it will have had its value from the time of its importation to the time of its recall . To furnish an argument against the import , the inconvenience likely to result from the recall must be not only very considerable , but superior to the whole amount of the benefit reaped previously to the recall . DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRINCIPLE " NO MORE TRADE THAN CAPITAL " , OR " CAPITAL LIMITS TRADE " . 1 . No branch of productive industry can be carried on without the help of a certain quantity of capital previously accumulated . 2 . The whole quantity of productive industry each individual can carry on , is limited by the quantity he has of his own , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of productive industry a nation can carry on , is limited by the quantity of capital it has of its own , or can borrow from other nations . The whole quantity of productive industry the world can carry on , is limited by the capital it has of its own , till it can find another world to borrow of . 3 . Credit need not be taken separately into the account : since credit is but capital borrowed , and the quantity that can be borrowed is limited by the quantity possessed . 4 . The quantity of capital limiting the quantity of productive industry , limits in the same proportion the possible quantity , and amount in value , of the produce of that industry , and thence of whatever part of it is capable of becoming the subject of trade . The quantity of capital sets the limit to the quantity of wealth : it likewise sets the limit to the quantity of trade . 5 . Therefore no regulations nor any efforts whatsoever , either on the part of subjects or governors , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an amount beyond what the productive powers of the quantity of capital in hand at the commencement of that period are capable of producing . 6 . A given quantity of capital may enable the employer to produce a greater quantity of wealth when employed in one way than when employed in another . Let the number of possible ways of employing capital be any number whatever , suppose a thousand : if a minister could make out that one certain mode would be more productive than any one of the remaining 999 , he would have reason for wishing that a certain portion of the national capital should be applied to that branch , in preference to all others. ( 36* ) But he would have no sufficient reason for so much as wishing it , till he had made out that superiority with respect to all the 999. ( 37* ) And though he had made it out ever so clear , he could have no warrantable ground for employing coercive measures to induce any one to engage in this most advantageous of all branches . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that , as soon as that superiority was made evident to them , men would betake themselves to that superior branch of their own accord , without being either hired or forced to do so . 7 . Vanity and weakness can alone give him a plea which would be sufficient to his own conscience , to warrant his employing force(38*) to such a purpose . And whichever plea such a persuasion might afford to his own conscience , it is a plea that could never be valid in the eyes of any other men . To every bystander the refusal of the persons concerned to engage in the business without being thus compelled or hired , would be a stronger reason for looking upon it as not being an advantageous one , than any it could ever be possible for him to give on the other side . PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE PRINCIPLE " NO MORE TRADE THAN CAPITAL " WITH RESPECT TO COLONIAL GOVERNMENT , ECONOMY AND PEACE What is it that would be the loss , suppose it to amount to any thing , that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The difference between the profit to be made by the employing in that trade so much capital as would be employed in it were the colony kept , and the profit that would be made by the employment of the same capital in any other way , suppose in the improvement of land . The loss is nothing , if the same capital employed in the improvement of land would be more productive : and it would be more productive by the amount of so much as would go to form the annual rent : for deducting that rent , capital employed in the improvement of land produces as much as if employed in any other way . If the loss were any thing , would it then amount to the whole difference between the profit upon that trade , and the profit upon the next most profitable one ? no : but only to the difference between so much of that difference as would be produced if the colony were retained in subjection , and so much as would be produced if the colony were declared free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the common mode of computation , is equal to the sum total of imports from that colony and exports to it put together . From this statement , if the foregoing observation be just , the following deductions will come to be made . 1 . The whole value of the exports to the colony . 2 . So much of the imports as is balanced by the exports . 3 . Such a portion of the above remainder as answers to so much of the trade as would be equally carried on , were the colony independent . 4 . So much of that reduced profit as would be made , were the same capital employed in any other trade or branch of industry lost by the independence of the colony . 5 . But the same capital , if employed in agriculture . would have produced a rent over and above the ordinary profits of capital : which rent , according to a general and undisputed computation , may be stated at a sum equal to the amount of those profits . Thence arises a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing the capital in the trade to the colony , in preference to the improvement of land , and thence upon the supposition that the continuance of the trade depended upon the keeping the colony in subjection . The other mischiefs resulting from the keeping of a colony in subjection , are : 1 . The expence of its establishment , civil and military . 2 . The contingent expence of wars and other coercive measures for keeping it in subjection . 3 . The contingent expence of wars for the defence of it against foreign powers . 4 . The force , military and naval , constantly kept on foot under the apprehension of such wars . 5 . The occasional danger to political liberty from the force thus kept up . 6 . The contingent expence of wars produced by alliances contracted for the purpose of supporting wars that may be brought on by the defence of it . 7 . The corruptive effects of the influence resulting from the patronage of the establishment , civil and military . 8 . The damage that must be done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national interest , which must be kept up in order to prevent the nation from opening their eyes and insisting upon the enfranchisement of the colony . 9 . The sacrifice that must be made of the real interest of the colony to this imaginary interest of the mother-country . It is for the purpose of governing it badly , and for no other , that you wish to get or keep a colony . Govern it well , it is of no use to you . To govern its inhabitants as well as they would govern themselves , you must choose to govern them those only whom they would themselves choose , you must sacrifice none of their interests to your own , you must bestow as much time and attention to their interests as they would themselves , in a word , you must take those very measures and no others , which they themselves would take . But would this be governing ? And what would it be worth to you , if it were ? After all , it would be impossible for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the distance . 10 . The bad government resulting to the mother-country from the complication , the indistinct views of things , and the consumption of time occasioned by this load of distant dependencies . AGRICULTURE NOT DEPENDENT ON MANUFACTURES The most advantageous employment for the community that can be made of capital is agriculture , because there the idle landlord shares in equal proportion with the labouring farmer . This can not be extended ad infinitum , to the exclusion of other employments of capital . It can be extended no farther than so far as the farmer finds his profit equal to the profit of stock in other employments of capital , which he would cease to do if this business were to be overstocked . What follows ? -- that as soon as this branch of business became so far stocked as to be less productive than others , capital would cease to be applied to it ; capital , instead of being applied to this business , would be applied to some other , i.e. manufactures . There would therefore be no occasion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go there of its own accord . It is therefore not true to say that manufactures are necessary to agriculture , and that manufactures must first be encreased before agriculture can be encreased . On the contrary , it is true to say that agriculture is necessary to manufactures , and that agriculture must first be encreased before manufactures can be encreased . Men must exist , before they can begin to work : raw materials of manufacture must exist before they can be worked . What makes the mistake is this . It is true that , when manufactures have encreased within the reach of an intercourse with cultivators , agriculture can be carried on in various respects to more advantage . Manufactures as well as agriculture afford by parsimony and storing a capital : and when a capital is laid up from manufactures , any part of it may as well be applied to agriculture as to any thing else . When applied to agriculture , the improvement of land enables a given quantity of land and labour to produce a greater quantity of produce . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . But this does not make it necessary , but unnecessary , to take capital by force from either , in order to bestow it upon the other . Could capital be drawn from the clouds , like manna , by praying , there would be no use in bestowing it upon one branch of industry in preference to another : for so much of this miraculous capital as was thrown into any channel , so much natural would be kept from flowing into it . Agriculture without manufactures , contributes most to population : agriculture with manufactures to wealth . Agriculture without manufactures makes men more numerous , and less wealthy : agriculture with manufactures makes men more wealthy , and consequently less numerous . The relative quantity of capital will encrease , and consequently the rate of interest fall , where thesaurisation goes on faster than population : and vice versa . When men have got more food than they want , they will be able and willing to give part of it for finer cloaths and finer furniture . But this does not make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and furniture , in order to induce others to produce food . The consumption of some sorts of corn in particular ways is limited , while the number of consumers is limited . When a man has as much bread as he can eat , he will not give any thing for any more . But this is not the case with other sorts of corn , or with the same sort of corn employed in another way . In England , the lowest wages of labour will always find a man more bread than he can eat : therefore considerably more wheat than is produced at present , would , if not exported , not find purchasers . But the lowest wages of labour , nor wages much above the lowest , will not find a man as much strong beer as he can drink , nor even as he can drink without hurting himself . Therefore , even independently of exportation. there is no danger of the nation 's being overstocked with such of the productions of agriculture as are fit for making beer . Apply this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no fear of there being at the same time more cream produced than every body who has any thing to give for it is able to eat , more fruit of all sorts , more poultry , more saddle horses , more coach-horses . With bread-corn it is possible that a market may be overstocked : but with such luxuries , and with all these luxuries put together , it is impossible that the market should be overstocked . And agriculture is just as capable of producing these articles as bread-corn . Agriculture then will always find a sufficient market for itself : it is impossible it should ever fail to do so . Therefore , for the purpose of a market , it can never stand in need of manufactures . And it has been shewn that it can not stand in need of manufactures for the purpose of laying up capital . Therefore it can not stand in need of manufactures for any purpose . Quere : when capital is plenty , what is the correlative that is comparatively scarce ? Hands adult and in actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be low , and real price of labour high . When capital is scarce , interest will be high , and the price ( real ) of labour low , unless kept up by an unnatural occasional demand such as that by war . What keeps down the quantity , and thence the value of capital is procreation , which multiplies little children who occasion expence before they can produce profit . These children as they grow up , encrease the number of labourers -- thence they 1 . keep down the price of labour , and 2. lessen the ratio of capital to hands . The same causes that promote accumulation , promote procreation . If accumulation goes on faster than procreation , capital will proportionably encrease , and the rate of interest proportionably sink . NOTES : 1 .

@@77496496 @6196496/ <p> Of the Balance of Trade by David Hume It is very usual , in nations ignorant of the nature of commerce , to prohibit the exportation of commodities , and to preserve among themselves whatever they think valuable and useful . They do not consider , that , in this prohibition , they act directly contrary to their intention ; and that the more is exported of any commodity , the more will be raised at home , of which they themselves will always have the first offer . It is well known to the learned , that the ancient laws of ATHENS rendered the exportation of figs criminal ; that being supposed a species of fruit so excellent in ATTICA , that the ATHENIANS deemed it too delicious for the palate of any foreigner . And in this ridiculous prohibition they were so much in earnest , that informers were thence called sycophants among them , from two GREEK words , which signify figs and discoverer . There are proofs in many old acts of parliament of the same ignorance in the nature of commerce , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in FRANCE , the exportation of corn is almost always prohibited ; in order , as they say , to prevent famines ; though it is evident , that nothing contributes more to the frequent famines , which so much distress that fertile country . The same jealous fear , with regard to money , has also prevailed among several nations ; and it required both reason and experience to convince any people , that these prohibitions serve to no other purpose than to raise the exchange against them , and produce a still greater exportation . These errors , one may say , are gross and palpable : But there still prevails , even in nations well acquainted with commerce , a strong jealousy with regard to the balance of trade , and a fear , that all their gold and silver may be leaving them . This seems to me , almost in every case , a groundless apprehension ; and I should as soon dread , that all our springs and rivers should be exhausted , as that money should abandon a kingdom where there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages ; and we need never be apprehensive of losing the former . It is easy to observe , that all calculations concerning the balance of trade are founded on very uncertain facts and suppositions . The custom-house books are allowed to be an insufficient ground of reasoning ; nor is the rate of exchange much better ; unless we consider it with all nations , and know also the proportions of the several sums remitted ; which one may safely pronounce impossible . Every man , who has ever reasoned on this subject , has always proved his theory , whatever it was , by facts and calculations , and by an enumeration of all the commodities sent to all foreign kingdoms . The writings of Mr GEE struck the nation with an universal panic , when they saw it plainly demonstrated , by a detail of particulars , that the balance was against them for so considerable a sum as must leave them without a single shilling in five or six years . But luckily , twenty years have since elapsed , with an expensive foreign war ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more plentiful among us than in any former period . Nothing can be more entertaining on this head than Dr. SWIFT ; an author so quick in discerning the mistakes and absurdities of others . He says , in his short view of the state of IRELAND , that the whole cash of that kingdom formerly amounted but to 500,000 l. ; that out of this the IRISH remitted every year a neat million to ENGLAND , and had scarcely any other source from which they could compensate themselves , and little other foreign trade than the importation of FRENCH wines , for which they paid ready money . The consequence of this situation , which must be owned to be disadvantageous , was , that , in a course of three years , the current money of IRELAND , from 500,000 l. was reduced to less than two . And at present , I suppose , in a course of 30 years it is absolutely nothing . Yet I know not how , that opinion of the advance of riches in IRELAND , which gave the Doctor so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every body . In short , this apprehension of the wrong balance of trade , appears of such a nature , that it discovers itself , wherever one is out of humour with the ministry , or is in low spirits ; and as it can never be refuted by a particular detail of all the exports , which counterbalance the imports , it may here be proper to form a general argument , that may prove the impossibility of this event , as long as we preserve our people and our industry . Suppose four-fifths of all the money in GREAT BRITAIN to be annihilated in one night , and the nation reduced to the same condition , with regard to specie , as in the reigns of the HARRYS and EDWARDS , what would be the consequence ? Must not the price of all labour and commodities sink in proportion , and every thing be sold as cheap as they were in those ages ? What nation could then dispute with us in any foreign market , or pretend to navigate or to sell manufactures at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In how little time , therefore , must this bring back the money which we had lost , and raise us to the level of all the neighbouring nations ? Where , after we have arrived , we immediately lose the advantage of the cheapness of labour and commodities ; and the farther flowing in of money is stopped by our fulness and repletion . Again , suppose , that all the money of GREAT BRITAIN were multiplied fivefold in a night , must not the contrary effect follow ? Must not all labour and commodities rise to such an exorbitant height , that no neighbouring nations could afford to buy from us ; while their commodities , on the other hand , became comparatively . so cheap , that , in spite of all the laws which could be formed , they would be run in upon us , and our money flow out ; till we fall to a level with foreigners , and lose that great superiority of riches , which had laid us under such disadvantages ? Now , it is evident , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they to happen miraculously , must prevent their happening in the common course of nature , and must for ever , in all neighbouring nations , preserve money nearly proportionable to the art and industry of each nation . All water , wherever it communicates , remains always at a level . Ask naturalists the reason ; they tell you , that , were it to be raised in any one place , the superior gravity of that part not being balanced , must depress it , till it meet a counterpoise ; and that the same cause , which redresses the inequality when it happens , must for ever prevent it , without some violent external operation . Can one imagine , that it had ever been possible , by any laws , or even by any art or industry , to have kept all the money in SPAIN , which the galleons have brought from the INDIES ? Or that all commodities could be sold in FRANCE for a tenth of the price which they would yield on the other side of the PYRENEES , without finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What other reason , indeed , is there , why all nations , at present , gain in their trade with SPAIN and PORTUGAL ; but because it is impossible to heap up money , more than any fluid , beyond its proper level ? The sovereigns of these countries have shown , that they wanted not inclination to keep their gold and silver to themselves , had it been in any degree practicable . But as any body of water may be raised above the level of the surrounding element , if the former has no communication with the later ; so in money , if the communication be cut off , by any material or physical impediment , ( for all laws alone are ineffectual ) there may , in such a case , be a very great inequality of money . Thus the immense distance of CHINA , together with the monopolies of our INDIA companies , obstructing the communication , preserve in EUROPE the gold and silver , especially the latter , in much greater plenty than they are found in that kingdom . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes abovementioned is still evident . The skill and ingenuity of EUROPE in general surpasses perhaps that of CHINA , with regard to manual arts and manufactures ; yet are we never able to trade thither without great disadvantage . And were it not for the continual recruits , which we receive from AMERICA , money would soon sink in EUROPE , and rise in CHINA , till it came nearly to a level in both places . Nor can any reasonable man doubt , but that industrious nation , were they as near us as POLAND or BARBARY , would drain us of the overplus of our specie , and draw to themselves a larger share of the WEST INDIAN treasures . We need not have recourse to a physical attraction , in order to explain the necessity of this operation . There is a moral attraction , arising from the interests and passions of men , which is full as potent and infallible . How is the balance kept in the provinces of every kingdom among themselves , but by the force of this principle , which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to rise or sink beyond the proportion of the labour and commodities which are in each province ? Did not long experience make people easy on this head , what a fund of gloomy reflections might calculations afford to a melancholy YORKSHIREMAN , while he computed and magnified the sums drawn to LONDON by taxes , absentees , commodities , and found on comparison the opposite articles so much inferior ? And no doubt , had the Heptarchy subsisted in ENGLAND , the legislature of each state had been continually alarmed by the fear of a wrong balance ; and as it is probable that the mutual hatred of these states would have been extremely violent on account of their close neighbourhood , they would have loaded and oppressed all commerce , by a jealous and superfluous caution . Since the union has removed the barriers between SCOTLAND and ENGLAND , which of these nations gains from the other by this free commerce ? Or if the former kingdom has received any encrease of riches , can it reasonably be accounted for by any thing but the encrease of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ENGLAND , before the union , as we learn from L'ABBE DU BOS , that SCOTLAND would soon drain them of their treasure , were an open trade allowed ; and on the other side the TWEED a contrary apprehension prevailed : With what justice in both , time has shown . What happens in small portions of mankind , must take place in greater . The provinces of the ROMAN empire , no doubt , kept their balance with each other , and with ITALY , independent of the legislature ; as much as the several counties of GREAT BRITAIN , or the several parishes of each county . And any man who travels over EUROPE at this day , may see , by the prices of commodities , that money , in spite of the absurd jealousy of princes and states , has brought itself nearly to a level ; and that the difference between one kingdom and another is not greater in this respect , than it is often between different provinces of the same kingdom . Men naturally flock to capital cities , sea-ports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more industry , more commodities , and consequently more money ; but still the latter difference holds proportion with the former , and the level is preserved . Our jealousy and our hatred of FRANCE are without bounds ; and the former sentiment , at least , must be acknowledged reasonable and well- grounded . These passions have occasioned innumerable barriers and obstructions upon commerce , where we are accused of being commonly the aggressors . But what have we gained by the bargain ? We lost the FRENCH market for our woollen manufactures , and transferred the commerce of wine to SPAIN and PORTUGAL , where we buy worse liquor at a higher price . There are few ENGLISHMEN who would not think their country absolutely ruined , were FRENCH wines sold in ENGLAND so cheap and in such abundance as to supplant , in some measure , all ale , and home- brewed liquors : But would we lay aside prejudice , it would not be difficult to prove , that nothing could be more innocent , perhaps advantageous . Each new acre of vineyard planted in FRANCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it requisite for the FRENCH to take the produce of an ENGLISH acre , sown in wheat or barley , in order to subsist themselves ; and it is evident , that we should thereby get command of the better commodity . There are many edicts of the FRENCH king , prohibiting the planting of new vineyards , and ordering all those which are lately planted to be grubbed up : So sensible are they , in that country , of the superior value of corn , above every other product . Mareschal VAUBAN complains often , and with reason , of the absurd duties which load the entry of those wines of LANGUEDOC , GUIENNE , and other southern provinces , that are imported into BRITANNY and NORMANDY , He entertained no doubt but these latter provinces could preserve their balance , notwithstanding the open commerce which he recommends . And it is evident , that a few leagues more navigation to ENGLAND would make no difference ; or if it did , that it must operate alike on the commodities of both kingdoms . There is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another by which we may raise money beyond its natural level in any kingdom ; but these cases , when examined , will be found to resolve into our general theory , and to bring additional authority to it . I scarcely know any method of sinking money below its level , but those institutions of banks , funds , and paper-credit , which are so much practised in this kingdom . These render paper equivalent to money , circulate it throughout the whole state , make it supply the place of gold and silver , raise proportionably the price of labour and commodities , and by that means either banish a great part of those precious metals , or prevent their farther encrease . What can be more shortsighted than our reasonings on this head ? We fancy , because an individual would be much richer , were his stock of money doubled , that the same good effect would follow were the money of every one encreased ; not considering , that this would raise as much the price of every commodity , and reduce every man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is only in our public negociations and transactions with foreigners , that a greater stock of money is advantageous ; and as our paper is there absolutely insignificant , we feel , by its means , all the i 'll effects arising from a great abundance of money , without reaping any of the advantages . Suppose that there are l2 millions of paper , which circulate in the kingdom as money , ( for we are not to imagine , that all our enormous funds are employed in that shape ) and suppose the real cash of the kingdom to be 18 millions : Here is a state which is found by experience to be able to hold a stock of 30 millions . I say , if it be able to hold it , it must of necessity have acquired it in gold and silver , had we not obstructed the entrance of these metals by this new invention of paper . Whence would it have acquired that sum ? From all the kingdoms of the world . But why ? Because , if you remove these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , compared with our neighbours ; and we must immediately draw from all of them , till we be full and saturate , so to speak , and can hold no more . By our present politics , we are as careful to stuff the nation with this fine commodity of bank-bills and chequer-notes , as if we were afraid of being overburthened with the precious metals . It is not to be doubted , but the great plenty of bullion in FRANCE is , in a great measure , owing to the want of paper-credit . The FRENCH have no banks : Merchants bills do not there circulate as with us : Usury or lending on interest is not directly permitted ; so that many have large sums in their coffers : Great quantities of plate are used in private houses ; and all the churches are full of it . By this means , provisions and labour still remain cheaper among them , than in nations that are not half so rich in gold and silver . The advantages of this situation , in point of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident to be disputed . The same fashion a few years ago prevailed in GENOA , which still has place in ENGLAND and HOLLAND , of using services of CHINA-ware instead of plate ; but the senate , foreseeing the consequence , prohibited the use of that brittle commodity beyond a certain extent ; while the use of silverplate was left unlimited . And I suppose , in their late distresses , they felt the good effect of this ordinance . Our tax on plate is , perhaps , in this view , somewhat impolitic . Before the introduction of paper-money into our colonies , they had gold and silver sufficient for their circulation . Since the introduction of that commodity , the least inconveniency that has followed is the total banishment of the precious metals . And after the abolition of paper , can it be doubted but money will return , while these colonies possess manufactures and commodities , the only thing valuable in commerce , and for whose sake alone all men desire money . What pity LYCURGUS did not think of paper-credit , when he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have served his purpose better than the lumps of iron he made use of as money . and would also have prevented more effectually all commerce with strangers , as being of so much less real and intrinsic value . It must , however , be confessed , that , as all these questions of trade and money are extremely complicated , there are certain lights , in which this subject may be placed , so as to represent the advantages of paper-credit and banks to be superior to their disadvantages . That they banish specie and bullion from a state is undoubtedly true ; and whoever looks no farther than this circumstance does well to condemn them ; but specie and bullion are not of so great consequence as not to admit of a compensation , and even an overbalance from the encrease of industry and of credit , which may be promoted by the right use of paper-money . It is well known of what advantage it is to a merchant to be able to discount his bills upon occasion ; and every thing that facilitates this species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . But private bankers are enabled to give such credit by the credit they receive from the depositing of money in their shops ; and the bank of ENGLAND in the same manner , from the liberty it has to issue its notes in all payments . There was an invention of this kind , which was fallen upon some years ago by the banks of EDINBURGH ; and which , as it is one of the most ingenious ideas that has been executed in commerce , has also been thought advantageous to SCOTLAND . It is there called a BANK-CREDIT ; and is of this nature . A man goes to the bank and finds surety to the amount , we shall suppose , of a thousand pounds . This money , or any part of it , he has the liberty of drawing out whenever he pleases , and he pays only the ordinary interest for it , while it is in his hands . He may , when he pleases , repay any sum so small as twenty pounds , and the interest is discounted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting from this contrivance , are manifold . As a man may find surety nearly to the amount of his substance , and his bank-credit is equivalent to ready money , a merchant does hereby in a manner coin his houses , his household furniture , the goods in his warehouse , the foreign debts due to him , his ships at sea ; and can , upon occasion , employ them in all payments , as if they were the current money of the country . If a man borrow a thousand pounds from a private hand , besides that it is not always to be found when required , he pays interest for it , whether he be using it or not : His bank-credit costs him nothing except during the very moment , in which it is of service to him : And this circumstance is of equal advantage as if he had borrowed money at much lower interest . Merchants , likewise , from this invention , acquire a great facility in supporting each other 's credit , which is a considerable security against bankruptcies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to any of his neighbours who is not in the same condition ; and he gets the money , which he replaces at his convenience . After this practice had taken place during some years at EDINBURGH , several companies of merchants at GLASGOW carried the matter farther . They associated themselves into different banks , and issued notes so low as ten shillings , which they used in all payments for goods , manufactures , tradesmen 's labour of all kinds ; and these notes , from the established credit of the companies , passed as money in all payments throughout the country . By this means , a stock of five thousand pounds was able to perform the same operations as if it were six or seven ; and merchants were thereby enabled to trade to a greater extent , and to require less profit in all their transactions . But whatever other advantages result from these inventions , it must still be allowed that , besides giving too great facility to credit , which is dangerous , they banish the precious metals ; and nothing can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison of the past and present condition of SCOTLAND in that particular . It was found , upon the recoinage made after the union , that there was near a million of specie in that country : But notwithstanding the great encrease of riches , commerce and manufactures of all kinds , it is thought , that , even where there is no extraordinary drain made by ENGLAND , the current specie will not now amount to a third of that sum . But as our projects of paper-credit are almost the only expedient , by which we can sink money below its level ; so , in my opinion , the only expedient , by which we can raise money above it , is a practice which we should all exclaim against as destructive , namely , the gathering of large sums into a public treasure , locking them up , and absolutely preventing their circulation . The fluid , not communicating with the neighbouring element , may , by such an artifice , be raised to what height we please . To prove this , we need only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any part of our cash ; where we found , that the immediate consequence of such an event would be the attraction of an equal sum from all the neighbouring kingdoms . Nor does there seem to be any necessary bounds set , by the nature of things , to this practice of hoarding . A small city , like GENEVA , continuing this policy for ages , might engross nine-tenths of the money of EUROPE . There seems , indeed , in the nature of man , an invincible obstacle to that immense growth of riches . A weak state , with an enormous treasure , will soon become a prey to some of its poorer , but more powerful neighbours . A great state would dissipate its wealth in dangerous and ill-concerted projects ; and probably destroy , with it , what is much more valuable , the industry , morals , and numbers of its people . The fluid , in this case , raised to too great a height , bursts and destroys the vessel that contains it ; and mixing itself with the surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little are we commonly acquainted with this principle , that , though all historians agree in relating uniformly so recent an event , as the immense treasure amassed by HARRY VII ( which they make amount to 2,700,000 pounds , ) we rather reject their concurring testimony , than admit of a fact , which agrees so i 'll with our inveterate prejudices . It is indeed probable , that this sum might be three- fourths of all the money in ENGLAND . But where is the difficulty in conceiving , that such a sum might be amassed in twenty years , by a cunning , rapacious , frugal , and almost absolute monarch ? Nor is it probable , that the diminution of circulating money was ever sensibly felt by the people , or ever did them any prejudice . The sinking of the prices of all commodities would immediately replace it , by giving ENGLAND the advantage in its commerce with the neighbouring kingdoms . Have we not an instance , in the small republic of ATHENS with its allies , who , in about fifty years , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much inferior to that of HARRY VII ? For all the GREEK historians and orators agree , that the ATHENIANS collected in the citadel more than 10,000 talents , which they afterwards dissipated to their own ruin , in rash and imprudent enterprizes . But when this money was set a running , and began to communicate with the surrounding fluid ; what was the consequence ? Did it remain in the state ? No . For we find , by the memorable census mentioned by DEMOSTHENES and POLYBIUS , that , in about fifty years afterwards , the whole value of the republic , comprehending lands , houses , commodities , slaves , and money , was less than 6000 talents . What an ambitious high-spirited people was this , to collect and keep in their treasury , with a view to conquests , a sum , which it was every day in the power of the citizens , by a single vote , to distribute among themselves , and which would have gone near to triple the riches of every individual ! For we must observe , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by ancient writers , to have been no greater at the beginning of the PELOPONNESIAN war , than at the beginning of the MACEDONIAN . Money was little more plentiful in GREECE during the age of PHILIP and PERSEUS , than in ENGLAND during that of HARRY VII : Yet these two monarchs in thirty years collected from the small kingdom of MACEDON , a larger treasure than that of the ENGLISH monarch . PAULUS AEMILIUS brought to ROME about 1,700,000 pounds Sterling . PLINY says , 2,400,000 . And that was but a part of the MACEDONIAN treasure . The rest was dissipated by the resistance and flight of PERSEUS . We may learn from STANIAN , that the canton of BERNE had 300,000 pounds lent at interest , and had above six times as much in their treasury . Here then is a sum hoarded of 1,800,000 pounds Sterling , which is at least quadruple what should naturally circulate in such a petty state ; and yet no one , who travels in the PAIS DE VAUX , or any part of that canton , observes any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country of that extent , soil , and situation . On the contrary , there are scarce any inland provinces in the continent of FRANCE or GERMANY , where the inhabitants are at this time so opulent , though that canton has vastly encreased its treasure since 1714 , the time when STANIAN wrote his judicious account of SWITZERLAND . The account given by APPIAN of the treasure of the PTOLEMIES , is so prodigious , that one can not admit of it ; and so much the less , because the historian says , that the other successors of ALEXANDER were also frugal , and had many of them treasures not much inferior . For this saving humour of the neighbouring princes must necessarily have checked the frugality of the EGYPTIAN monarchs , according to the foregoing theory . The sum he mentions is 740,000 talents , or 191,166,666 pounds 13 shillings and 4 pence , according to Dr. ARBUTHNOT 'S computation . And yet APPIAN says , that he extracted his account from the public records ; and he was himself a native of ALEXANDRIA . From these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those numberless bars , obstructions , and imposts , which all nations of EUROPE , and none more than ENGLAND , have put upon trade ; from an exorbitant desire of amassing money , which never will heap up beyond its level , while it circulates ; or from an ill-grounded apprehension of losing their specie , which never will sink below it . Could any thing scatter our riches , it would be such impolitic contrivances . But this general i 'll effect , however , results from them , that they deprive neighbouring nations of that free communication and exchange which the Author of the world has intended , by giving them soils , climates , and geniuses , so different from each other . Our modern politics embrace the only method of banishing money , the using of paper-credit ; they reject the only method of amassing it , the practice of hoarding ; and they adopt a hundred contrivances , which serve to no purpose but to check industry , and rob ourselves and our neighbours of the common benefits of art and nature . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be regarded as prejudicial or useless , but those only which are founded on the jealousy above-mentioned . A tax on GERMAN linen encourages home manufactures , and thereby multiplies our people and industry . A tax on brandy encreases the sale of rum , and supports our southern colonies . And as it is necessary , that imposts should be levied , for the support of government , it may be thought more convenient to lay them on foreign commodities , which can easily be intercepted at the port , and subjected to the impost . We ought , however , always to remember the maxim of Dr. SWIFT , That , in the arithmetic of the customs , two and two make not four , but often make only one . It can scarcely be doubted , but if the duties on wine were lowered to a third , they would yield much more to the government than at present : Our people might thereby afford to drink commonly a better and more wholesome liquor ; and no prejudice would ensue to the balance of trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ale beyond the agriculture is but inconsiderable , and gives employment to few hands . The transport of wine and corn would not be much inferior . But are there not frequent instances , you will say , of states and kingdoms , which were formerly rich and opulent , and are now poor and beggarly ? Has not the money left them , with which they formerly abounded ? I answer , If they lose their trade , industry , and people , they can not expect to keep their gold and silver : For these precious metals will hold proportion to the former advantages . When LISBON and AMSTERDAM got the EAST-INDIA trade from VENICE and GENOA , they also got the profits and money which arose from it . Where the seat of government is transferred , where expensive armies are maintained at a distance , where great funds are possessed by foreigners ; there naturally follows from these causes a diminution of the specie . But these , we may observe , are violent and forcible methods of carrying away money , and are in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But where these remain , and the drain is not continued , the money always finds its way back again , by a hundred canals , of which we have no notion or suspicion . What immense treasures have been spent , by so many nations , in FLANDERS , since the revolution , in the course of three long wars ? More money perhaps than the half of what is at present in EUROPE . But what has now become of it ? Is it in the narrow compass of the AUSTRIAN provinces ? No , surely : It has most of it returned to the several countries whence it came , and has followed that art and industry , by which at first it was acquired . For above a thousand years , the money of EUROPE has been flowing to ROME , by an open and sensible current ; but it has been emptied by many secret and insensible canals : And the want of industry and commerce renders at present the papal dominions the poorest territory in all ITALY . In short , a government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactures . Its money , it may safely trust to the course of human affairs , without fear or jealousy . Or if it ever give attention to this latter circumstance , it ought only to be so far as it affects the former .

The report highlights a crisis in part-time numbers , which have fallen for a seventh consecutive year , a decline of 61% since 2010-11 . Since more than 90% of part-time students are over 21 , this has also led to a significant decline in the number of mature students in the sector . <p> This also means that , overall , the number of students entering universities has fallen significantly since 2012 . <p> If you read some of the good news in OFFAs report , you might wonder why this decline in part-time and mature numbers matters . The caricature of a mature student is a wealthier person taking a degree for leisure later in life . Meanwhile , UCAS data for the 2016 cycle shows that 18 year-olds from neighbourhoods that have traditionally had low participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before : 29% higher than in 2012-13 . <p> But the decline in mature students matters deeply for a whole variety of reasons : <p> If we really want to address widening participation , then we need to work with mature students , as they are more likely to be from disadvantaged groups . <p> Adults and the diversity and life experience they bring is valuable to the learning environment . <p> The number of under 18 year-olds- is decreasing , so the sector needs to adjust . <p> To influence young students from disadvantaged backgrounds , parents and other adults are key and one person can end up changing participation in a whole community . <p> What do we know about mature students ? <p> Data we have collected on mature applicants from three UCAS cycles to the University of Bristol ( see Figure 1 ) shows that mature applicants are much more likely than standard-age applicants to be : <p> the first in their family to attend university ; <p> from an ethnic minority ; <p> from a lower socio-economic group ; <p> to have a disability ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On some of our courses that are designed to cater for mature students , such as the Foundation Year in Arts and Humanities , weve also found that students who have taken time out of education , whether they are 18 or 25 or 75 , are much more likely to have experienced multiple forms of disadvantage . <p> In other words , the 61% drop in part-time students since 2010 represents a catastrophic loss of opportunities for some of those already most excluded from higher education . New work with mature students is vital if universities , and the government , are serious about involving those from lower socio-economic groups , ethnic minorities and communities with little or no contact with higher education . <p> Today the Open University is launching a new report on outreach with disadvantaged mature students , for which the Foundation Year at Bristol has been one case study , alongside courses at the OU , Birkbeck and Leeds .

You can try out the tool and see how your institution fares . Such an approach is vital if such work is to be integral and not just an optional extra , and it could form part of a larger strategy to create a whole-institution approach to diversity . <p> We suggest going further . Why not require all institutions to take 20% of their admissions in future via a route in which no prior qualifications are required ? The Open University has led the way in this area .

@@13268812 @1868812/ <h> FAQ <h> What is Earth Engine ? <p> Earth Engine is a platform for petabyte-scale scientific analysis and visualization of geospatial datasets , both for public benefit and for business and government users . <p> Earth Engine stores satellite imagery , organizes it , and makes it available for the first time for global-scale data mining . The public data archive includes historical earth imagery going back more than forty years , and new imagery is collected every day . Earth Engine also provides APIs in JavaScript and Python , as well as other tools , to enable the analysis of large datasets . <h> How is Earth Engine different from Google Earth ? <p> Earth Engine and Google Earth serve different purposes . Google Earth enables you to travel and learn about the world through a virtual globe . You can view satellite imagery , maps , terrain , 3D buildings and much more . Earth Engine , on the other hand , is a tool for analyzing geospatial information . Although Earth Engine has a data catalog , not everything available in Google Earth is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the data in Earth Engine is not currently available for visualization in Google Earth . <h> Why is Google working on Earth Engine ? <p> Google 's mission is to organize the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful . In line with this mission , Earth Engine organizes geospatial information and makes it available for analysis . More generally , Google strives to make the world a better place through the use of technology . Earth Engine 's technical infrastructure powers humanitarian , scientific , and environmental initiatives which Google is proud to support . <h> How do I get access ? <p> To get access to the advanced features of Earth Engine , please fill out the form at https : **31;67;TOOLONG . We are not accepting all applications , so please fill out all fields as best you can so we can evaluate your request for access . <p> If you are accepted , you will receive an email titled " Google Groups : You 've been added to **27;100;TOOLONG " within one week of applying . Please read that email , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get access . <h> Is Earth Engine available for commercial use ? <p> Earth Engine 's terms allow for use in development , evaluation , research , and education environments . It may be evaluated in a commercial or operational environment but use is not allowed for sustained production use , and data products generated by Earth Engine may not be sold . However , we do have a commercial license program , so if you are interested in pursuing a commercial application of our product , please contact us at **33;129;TOOLONG . <h> Who uses Earth Engine , what are some examples of how it 's being used ? <p> Earth Engine is used by researchers , nonprofits , educators , and governmental agencies who use the system to analyze large scale geospatial data . Please refer to our Case Studies for examples of how Earth Engine is being used . <h> How does Earth Engine compare to the Landsat and Sentinel data in Google Cloud ? <p> The Earth Engine team has worked in close collaboration with Google Cloud to bring the Landsat and Sentinel-2 collections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The collections in Google Cloud are best suited to workflows where you need to access the data directly from Cloud services such as Google Compute Engine or Google Cloud Machine Learning . The Earth Engine Code Editor and the Earth Engine API do not access these Cloud collections but instead use the Earth Engine data catalog directly . <h> Can I use my own proprietary imagery and vector data ? <h> Must I display my Earth Engine results on a Google Map ? <p> You are free to display Earth Engine results in any mapping platform . <h> Can I share the results of my analysis ? <p> We encourage Earth Engine users to share the results . Results and analysis scripts may be shared directly with other Earth Engine users through Earth Engine tools , or may be downloaded and shared like any other data . <h> Who owns the algorithms I write in Earth Engine and the results of my analyses ? <p> You do . The results of all analyses you perform are yours . All algorithms that you write with our API are yours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support do you offer ? <p> Once you have been given access to Earth Engine , you may join our Developers list where Earth Engine staff and other Earth Engine users answer questions about each other 's scripts . Approximately once a year , generally in early December , we open up the Earth Engine Research Awards for proposals . We do frequent Earth Engine trainings , which are typically announced on the Developer 's list , as well as through the Google Earth Outreach mailing list . These include the annual Earth Engine User Summit and the Geo for Good conference , typically held at the Googleplex in Mountain View , CA.

Their new platform , Kolibri , runs on numerous devices , from repurposed desktop computers to low-cost , off-the-shelf file storage drives , and helps educators access , organize , and customize digital content , even in the most remote locations . So far they 've brought 7,000 videos and 26,000 interactive exercises offline for students in about 160 countries . <p> Our funding , along with Google volunteers providing technical support , will help Learning Equality build a bigger content library and scale their reach to hundreds of thousands of new students . This summer , Google engineers and product experts are volunteering to spend four weeks working side-by-side with Learning Equality 's product team in areas such as UX/UI , content integration , and video compression technology . <h> 2 .

It improves power quality and reliability , lowers power prices by allowing more efficient dispatch , and enables much higher penetrations of intermittent solar and wind than would otherwise be possible . Our modeling indicates that grid storage , when combined with breakthroughs in solar and wind could increase renewables deployment by up to 35% by 2050 . <p> In the short term , much cheaper storage , absent innovations in wind and solar that reduce their cost to below coal , could actually drive an increase in coal consumption . Cheaper storage would enable already cheap coal units to run at peak efficiency 24 hours/day , store energy at night and dispatch it during the day -- reducing the demand for load-following natural gas capacity and ultimately resulting in a slight ( 0.3% ) increase in greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions .

Ultimately , we determined that an update using the peak from the 2012-2013 season provided a close approximation of flu activity for recent seasons . We will be applying this update to the US flu level estimates for the 2013-2014 flu season , starting from August 1st .

That 's why we 've worked hard to be carbon neutral as a company , launched our renewable energy cheaper than coal initiative and have invested in several clean energy companies and projects around the world . <p> But what if we knew the value of innovation in clean energy technologies ? How much could new technologies contribute to our economic growth , enhance our energy security or reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions ? Robust data can help us understand these important questions , and the role innovation in clean energy could play in addressing our future economic , security and climate challenges . <p> Through Google.org , our energy team set out to answer some of these questions . Using McKinseys Low Carbon Economics Tool ( LCET ) , we assessed the long-term economic impacts for the U.S. assuming breakthroughs were made in several different clean energy technologies , like wind , geothermal and electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interlinked models that estimates the potential economic and technology implications of various policy and technology assumptions . <p> The analysis is based on a model and includes assumptions and conclusions that Google.org developed , so it is n't a prediction of the future .

Here are just some of the most compelling findings : <p> Energy innovation pays off big : We compared " business as usual " ( BAU ) to scenarios with breakthroughs in clean energy technologies . On top of those , we layered a series of possible clean energy policies ( more details in the report ) . We found that by 2030 , when compared to BAU , breakthroughs could help the U.S. : <p> Reduce U.S. total carbon emissions by 13% in 2030 ( 21% with Clean Policy ) <p> Speed matters and delay is costly : Our model found a mere five year delay ( 2010-2015 ) in accelerating technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregate 1.2-1.4 million net unrealized jobs and 8-28 more gigatons of potential GHG emissions by 2050 . <p> Policy and innovation can enhance each other : Combining clean energy policies with technological breakthroughs increased the economic , security and pollution benefits for either innovation or policy alone . Take GHG emissions : the model showed that combining policy and innovation led to 59% GHG reductions by 2050 ( vs. 2005 levels ) , while maintaining economic growth . <p> This analysis assumed that breakthroughs in clean energy happened and that policies were put in place , and then tried to understand the impact . The data here allows us to imagine a world in which the U.S. captures the potential benefits of some clean energy technologies : economic growth , job generation and a reduction in harmful emissions . We have n't developed the roadmap , and getting there will take the right mix of policies , sustained investment in technological innovation by public and private institutions and mobilization of the private sectors entrepreneurial energies .

Every time I return from the region , I am energized by the dynamism of the young people I meet but overwhelmed by the challenges the region faces . The combination of high oil and food prices affects the United States economy , to be sure , but the impact on poor people in poor countries is exponentially greater . People have to make hard decisions like taking their children out of school , rationing the little food they have , and in some cases not eating at all . High fuel prices also contribute to lower uses of fertilizer , resulting in lower agricultural yields . The cycle spirals in a way that hurts the poorest people the most . <p> And yet there is another story unfolding simultaneously in Eastern Africa . It is the story of Safaricom , the most successful telecom company on the continent . Safaricom started trading publicly on the Nairobi stock exchange in June and catalyzed the largest IPO on the continent ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all walks of life , resulting in an over-subscription of stock of more than 400% .

Infrastructure has long been a constraint on economic development and growth in Africa but nobody imagined that a new technology would completely leap-frog the traditional phone and fundamentally disrupt telephony in Africa . I ca n't help but think about rural energy in the same light . Today , countries like Uganda are still 90% unserved by electricity .

What would this look like given large geo-thermal and bio-diesel reserves in East Africa and can renewable energy sources provide opportunities for greener solutions in Africa ? <p> Interacting with dynamic and bright Africans under 30 ( who make up 70% or more of most African countries ) , I can not help but wonder what is on the horizon . People are innovating all over the continent with bio-gas , small scale hydro , wind , and solar power . Where people have electricity , there is a massive difference in economic activity , public services , productivity , and hope about the future . Energy is truly a platform that affects nearly every aspect of rural life . Today , Africa is mostly unserved by power grids but given innovation possibilities , are there not scalable ways to introduce renewable energy to millions of people who are completely unplugged from the global economy today ?

Aid organizations have been hard at work and cities are starting to show signs of recovery , but the damage is beyond imagination and there are still thousands of people at shelters grappling with daily challenges . As a native of Sendai city , I 'm still speechless seeing the destruction and damage that has been done to the places I love and care about . <p> Weve been looking for ways we can assist in the relief efforts using Googles map-related tools . A few days after the quake , we published updated satellite imagery of northeast Japan in Google Maps and Google Earth , which illustrated the massive scale of devastation in the affected areas . <p> Today , we 've published imagery of the Sendai region at even higher resolution , which we collected on Sunday and Monday .

Suggestions include piggybacking on non-telecom infrastructure investments , creating an Internet exchange point , and opening spectrum in WiMax , WiFi and TV white spaces for ISPs . <p> In putting this white paper together , we benefited from the diversity of global challenges that Googlers have experienced when working with networks . The paper also taps into the first-hand knowledge of local stakeholders across public , private , and non-profit sectors . In collaboration with the many complementary players in Liberia , we aim to turn technology opportunity into development progress . <h> 3/16/2011 11:52:00 PM <p> Like the rest of the world , we 've been transfixed by the images and news coming out of the northeastern part of Japan over the past six days .

Ninety-three percent of mobile users in Japan do n't  have top-of-the-line smartphones , so weve recently optimized this Crisis Response page to make it more readable for a wider range of devices . You can also access that version by scanning this QR code : <p> Person FinderWithin the first two hours of the earthquake , we launched Person Finder so people can enter the names of those they 're looking for or have found .

Those photos are automatically uploaded to a public Picasa Web Album . We use scanning technology to help us manually add these names to Person Finder ; but its a big job that ca n't be done automatically by computers alone , so we welcome volunteers with Japanese language skills who want to help out . <p> Satellite imagesWere also working with our satellite partners GeoEye and DigitalGlobe to provide frequent updates to our imagery of the hardest-hit areas to first responders as well as the general public .

There was no way to find out where people 's family and friends were , if transportation would be available to get us home , and most importantly , whether we would be able to find shelter . <p> This experience helped me remember that during a crisis , information about shelters can become increasingly muddled .

At that time we announced a request for investment proposals ( RFP ) from teams working on technologies relevant to this goal . Today we are pleased to announce our first RechargeIT investments in two promising companies tackling the challenge of vehicle electrification.Aptera Motors of Carlsbad , California is building an ultra-high efficiency vehicle based on improved aerodynamics and composite materials .

As part of this project , we created the GFleet , a free car-sharing program for Google employees . The GFleet includes a handful of hybrid vehicles converted to plug-ins with a Hymotion conversion module . <p> Our plug-in hybrid electric vehicles ( PHEVs ) have been on the road for about a year now , and the RechargeIT team has been diligently collecting statistics on their performance . We noticed that employees primarily use our plug-ins for short trips close to our headquarters , so the data were n't truly representative of typical U.S. driving patterns . We were curious to see how the cars would perform under controlled conditions - and how they would stack up against other conventional automobiles typically found in U.S. households . With that , the RechargeIT Driving Experiment was born ! <p> In total , it took just over seven weeks to complete all the trips in all the vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , with the Priuses getting more than 90 miles per gallon .

Media coverage in Dar es Salaam indicates the report has already made an impression and is prompting the government to act . <p> For too long , success in the education sector has been defined by the number of schools and classrooms built and by the increase in student enrollment - measures that do n't necessarily register learning . But the conversation is now shifting : " quality " has become more front and center , forcing governments and development agencies to re-evaluate their policies . <p> Its hard to address the " quality " issue without knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HakiElimus report captures a " snapshot of the quality of education actually provided in schools by presenting the results of short tests administered to children in primary and secondary schools . " The sample pool is small , but the findings are interesting indicators of what may be happening in much of the country . Here are two of the findings that I found most powerful and alarming : <p> One of the tests was a short dictation in both Kiswahili , the national language , and English ( a total of 483 primary school students and 559 secondary school students were tested ) . While students scored higher on the Kiswahili dictations , HakiElimu found it " concerning that 25% of primary pupils Kiswahili dictations were rated " poor . " Pupils who took this test had completed six years of schooling in Kiswahili and yet one in four were unable to write a coherent paragraph as dictated in the national language . In the dictations , students in both primary and secondary schools made fundamental errors in punctuation , giving researchers the impression that these things are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case for letters . Similarly , many did not appear to have a sense of spacing between words , or between letters in the word and between sentences . Knowledge of punctuation was also limited " ( page 29 ) <p> The next point is equally alarming : Primary school students are taught in Kiswahili while in secondary schools the language of instruction is in English . As the report indicates , this is problematic . <p> " Overall , data show that while childrens Kiswahili language competencies are generally well developed , English language competencies are poorly developed in both primary and secondary school students . Students had difficulty in reading , writing and translating the language . This is particularly troublesome in case of secondary school students . On entering secondary schools , children not only have to relearn all the terms and concepts in a new language but also to take on a more difficult set of subjects . If the majority of the students in secondary schools are unable to read and understand the language in which they are taught , as our data show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhanced . ( page 33 ) <p> My colleagues and I often say " you ca n't fix what you cant see . " This report helps to highlight to communities , organizations and the government that while money might be spent on education , there are still significant gaps in learning outcomes . More information and data about these outcomes help create the metrics , so action can be taken to fix these gaps . We are proud of HakiElimu 's work and their commitment to ensuring that citizens and government know more about the quality of education in Tanzania . We believe that the information and the discussions it is sparking in Tanzania are important first steps toward improving the educational system . <h> Wednesday 7/09/2008 09:45:00 AM <p> I recently returned from a research trip across four East African countries . Every time I return from the region , I am energized by the dynamism of the young people I meet but overwhelmed by the challenges the region faces .

People have to make hard decisions like taking their children out of school , rationing the little food they have , and in some cases not eating at all .

The cycle spirals in a way that hurts the poorest people the most . <p> And yet there is another story unfolding simultaneously in Eastern Africa . It is the story of Safaricom , the most successful telecom company on the continent . Safaricom started trading publicly on the Nairobi stock exchange in June and catalyzed the largest IPO on the continent ever . More than $800 million was raised from Kenyans from all walks of life , resulting in an over-subscription of stock of more than 400% . Mobile is growing faster in Africa than in any other part of the world .

Infrastructure has long been a constraint on economic development and growth in Africa but nobody imagined that a new technology would completely leap-frog the traditional phone and fundamentally disrupt telephony in Africa . I ca n't help but think about rural energy in the same light . Today , countries like Uganda are still 90% unserved by electricity . Can you imagine not having power in 90% of any country and still trying to grow the economy ? Do we expect Africans to wait for grid electricity to incrementally reach people or are there disruptive innovations that can provide off-grid renewable energy to rural Africans in scaleable ways ? What would this look like given large geo-thermal and bio-diesel reserves in East Africa and can renewable energy sources provide opportunities for greener solutions in Africa ? <p> Interacting with dynamic and bright Africans under 30 ( who make up 70% or more of most African countries ) , I can not help but wonder what is on the horizon .

I served as start up Executive Director for Google.org for nearly three years before moving into the role of Chief Philanthropic Evangelist in February . I love Google , the people who make this such a special place and the world-class team at Google.org . Megan Smith , who has taken on the leadership of Google.org , is doing a terrific job and I am watching her and the other leaders of Google.org with admiration and a great sense of satisfaction that " the work " has passed to such competent hands . <p> When Larry , Sergey and Sheryl Sandberg hired me , I promised to work for at least three years .

He described to me his vision of bundling his many activities to focus them on these " Urgent Threats . " Jeff is the founder of the well regarded Skoll Foundation which for ten years has funded dozens of dedicated social entrepreneurs working all over the world . He also has an extremely successful film making company , Participant Media , which has made films to inspire social change such as An Inconvenient Truth , Good Night and Good Luck , North Country , Syriana , Fast Food Nation , Jimmy Carter - Man From Plains , Darfur Now , The Kite Runner , Charlie Wilson 's War and The Visitor .

He asked me to become President of the Skoll Urgent Threats Fund , sit on the board of the Skoll Foundation , and be Senior Advisor to him on his media and financial investments companies . <p> I have accepted this position and effective May 5 , 2009 ( my 65th birthday ) I will leave Google as a full time employee though I 'll continue to work with Megan and the Google.org team as an advisor . <p> Google.org and the Skoll Foundation already work together to support " virus hunter " Nathan Wolfe whose Global Viral Forecasting Initiative collects and analyzes blood samples of humans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awardees have played an important role in our thinking at Google.org and in the development of other projects and grants . <p> So these two organizations are neither competitors nor strangers , but rather friends and colleagues . I am not " leaving Google " so much as I 'm going down the road to work with a friend and colleague and I hope that in the coming months and years we can expand that relationship even more . <p> Looking back over the past three years , I 'm incredibly proud of the work done by the team at Google.org to support wonderful projects and people . Some examples : The team at Pratham in India that we support is changing the way we think about development by causing improvements in children 's education in India . Irene Taylor Brodsky 's Oscar nominated film , The Final Inch , is also helping to galvanize global support for the final push to eradicate polio . Working on this film helped my thinking about the media--Rotary International clubs have donated nearly $1 billion to global polio eradication , but you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch The Final Inch and see how much their donated time and money really matters to conquer this disease . They feel their work recognized and celebrated , and they are energized to go raise more money and do more volunteering to conquer this dreaded disease . And the group which emerged from the TED Prize , InSTEDD , is going from " strength to strength " and developing new technologies to enable quick communication and effective response after disasters . At one time they were funded only by Google.org but their work has now been recognized by CDC and by the United Nations emergency relief groups as best in the world and they are being supported by a wide group of organizations . <p> We 've also partnered with Rockefeller Foundation in supporting the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance Network program which is providing early warning about possible pandemic flu outbreaks to the six countries which border the Mekong River .

We 've invested in wind , solar and geothermal companies , we 've supported leaders like NRDC , and we advocated in DC for climate change policy and for more resources to drive clean energy R&amp;D . And it has made a big difference in how our government has now responded . <p> Larry and Sergey wrote in their initial Letter from the Founders that they wanted to make approximately 1% of Google 's equity and profits and substantial employee time devoted to philanthropy . I hope other corporations will follow the example to devote significant resources to the greater good and I support Google.org 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology to address the global challenges of our age .

I especially want to thank the Googlers , both in " dotorg " and " dotcom " that make Google such a special place . I wish time and space allowed me to name each and every one who has taught me , touched me , helped and supported me . I do believe the press which says that this is the best company to work for anywhere . Googlers are the kindest and most wonderful colleagues and friends anyone could ask for .

So it was n't surprising that when we considered areas to support with our philanthropic efforts , helping entrepreneurs in developing countries rose to the top . This past January we launched an initiative to Fuel the Growth of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises ( SMEs ) . SMEs in developed countries account for half of GDP and two-thirds of jobs , but they 're largely absent in developing countries . We wanted to explore how we could help drive capital to these high-growth businesses . At the same time , we launched a parallel effort to increase access to vital information in poor countries . This effort , known as Inform and Empower , aims to help improve the quality of public services by organizing critical information and making it accessible to all ( sound familiar ? ) . <p> We still strongly believe that growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google 's ten organizing principles is , " it 's best to do one thing really , really well . " As we evaluated our efforts this past year , it became clear that given Google.org 's unique strengths - including the ability to tap Google engineers to build and link better pathways to information - we could have a greater impact on the lives of the poor by focusing our efforts on Inform and Empower . As a result , we 're putting our SME initiative on the back burner . We 'll continue to support the grants and investments that we 've already committed under the initiative . We have observed and learned from many others addressing the challenges of financing SMEs -- many of whom are seeing significant strong results -- and we hope they continue with great success . At this time , however , we will not fund new efforts in the SME space . <p> Google remains committed to its philanthropic goal : using information and technology to take on some of the world 's greatest challenges . We continue to draw upon resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as outlined by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in their 2004 letter to investors . We 've had a strong year of giving since the launch of our initiatives . We know that the global financial crisis is disproportionately affecting the poor and plan to increase our overall giving in 2009 . <h> Friday 12/19/2008 11:53:00 AM <p> In early 2008 , Google.org announced its initiatives to the world and made clear how the company would leverage its people , money , and creativity to address some of the worlds most pressing and difficult problems . Among them were climate change/renewable energy , global poverty , and emerging threats . <p> In Africa , one of our initiatives is focused on leveraging the power of information ( or the right to know ) to increase transparency , accountability , and ultimately the delivery and quality of public services . " You ca n't change what you cant see " is one of our mantras , and our job is to shine light in dark places and help people decipher the black box of public service delivery . What is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to plug holes in a leaky pipeline of service delivery ? <p> Much of the initiative is about unlocking quasi-public information . One of my colleagues calls it DBHD ( database hugging disorder ) . Why is so much " public " information not accessible ( ie government budgets , service level indicators , population data ) and sitting on servers in London , New York , and Geneva but not accessible to citizens , media , and even planners in Africa countries ? This clearly needs to change . <p> What is less intuitive , however , is that there is so much information , knowledge , and wisdom within Africa that is not making its way to politicians , planners , and policy makers who make decisions about Africa . We often hear that teachers , nurses , and civil servants do not show-up for work across the continent and this is a primary contributor to the poor quality of public services . Do we bother asking why absenteeism is such a problem ? Ask teachers , nurses , or administrators and they will tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adopted in many African countries more than a decade ago , classroom sizes have doubled if not tripled while teacher salaries , instructional materials , and training have hardly changed at all . Government dispensaries are rarely stocked with medications that people come to purchase so why bother staffing clinics ? <p> Last month in rural Uganda , I saw an example of how information gathered from students is helping a local NGO address pupil absenteeism in a very targeted way . The primary school has created a student-led club that investigates why students are missing school and why they drop-out . After all , fellow students face similar challenges and know much about their peers . It turns out that most students dropping out are girls ; early pregnancy and lack of finances to purchase school uniforms are leading causes of student absenteeism . <p> With this information in hand , the Kabarole Research Centre is working with student leaders to plant a community garden to raise money to buy uniforms for needy students , and both are working with community leaders and parents committees to raise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several young girls have returned to school after giving birth , and school administrators are more aware of what needs to happen to reduce student attrition . <p> And so its not just about delivering information to people so they can make better decisions . Its also about listening to people to make sure donors , planners , and government officials make better decisions . Using student leaders to understand better why their peers are missing school may seem obvious , but such approaches are pretty rare in top-down systems . Better information is certainly not a panacea but its a necessary condition to make better decisions based on evidence rather than anecdote . <h> Thursday 12/18/2008 10:40:00 AM <p> There 's a great deal of talk about the high cost of oil and the billions of dollars that the US and other oil-importing nations spend each year to buy oil .

( You can see these selections by clicking on the buttons below the map on the RMI website . ) One interesting time period is from 1982 to 1985 , when low prices caused oil imports from the Middle East to decline to very low levels . <p> The map also looks at potential oil from offshore drilling and exploration of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) . The screenshot below illustrates the impact of off-shore drilling .

Over 200,000 people eat such dishes every day in the Accra fast food sector . While most local consumers might have a higher resistance to the diarrhea causing-rotavirus than Ghanas average tourists , there is no resistance when it comes to cholera , as the current outbreak in Zimbabwe shows . <p> Most sanitation models are imported from the developed world and seldom fit the conditions and capacities in low-income countries which explains the catastrophic statistics given above - and jeopardizes their purpose of safeguarding public health .

As a Google volunteer , I had an opportunity to interact with this years participants by teaching a class on presentation skills , judging the final round of the competition , and conducting one on one consulting sessions . I also visited the growing operations of 3 winners from last year and saw firsthand how the Believe Begin Become program has contributed to the success of their business . <p> I was both impressed and humbled by every entrepreneur I met . They all exhibited a level of energy , passion and enthusiasm that was overwhelmingly contagious . Operating in an environment where sound infrastructure is not a given , poverty is a reality , and health issues abound , they are seeking to create and build sustainable businesses that will change their community and their country for the better . <p> This years top winner of the overall business plan competition , Sheila Ocansey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , embodies this energy and passion . With FrutyFresh , she plans to package and distribute quality fresh fruit to local Ghanaian professionals , families , and children . Sheila was thoughtful enough to bring a sample of her product to her oral presentation , something that impressed all of the judges . I craved FrutyFresh fruit for its freshness , quality , and taste throughout the rest of my stay in Ghana . The other top winners include : Darko Abednego , Stanley Adjei , Yaw Agyei-Henaku , Joseph Brenyah , Savior Deikumah , Nikoe Gavu , Mary Koranteng , Daniel Oduro , and Joseph Tettey . <p> I observed firsthand the promise of what is possible for this years winners through visits with three winners from last year . Nicholas Vordzgbe of City Wash launched his mobile car wash service using a highly profitable , environmentally friendly approach to a common activity . City Wash is capable of washing an SUV with just 2 liters of water ! His next move includes opening a point of service location and expanding his mobile activities . Isaac Bohulu launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a room that should have been his master bedroom , he is running a government approved production facility for his flagship product , Neemfresh Herbal Mouthwash , made from completely natural ingredients . Finally , last years overall winner , Joseph Tackie of MeatyFoods , showed us how a shift in his marketing strategy allowed him to quintuple his revenues in one month . While we sampled the butchers spicy sausage , he told us of his plans to open his second store . <p> The Believe Begin Become program was launched with the hope that we would create an ecosystem of entrepreneurs , investors , customers , and employees that contribute to the growth and economic development of Ghana . Participating in the judging process , seeing the operations in action , and spending time with the entrepreneurs provided evidence that this is exactly what is happening . Participants from last year have become customers and/or suppliers of each other . Last years winner was a mentor to at least 3 of the winners from this year . The judges and potential investors have high standards ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are personally engaged and interested in their success .

He delivered a powerful talk that highlighted the risk of a devastating future pandemic , and described one of his big ideas for combating the threat . His mantra of ' Early Detection , Early Response ' inspired other groups such as InSTEDD , who recently launched a suite of open-source applications to allow collaboration between first responders during disease outbreaks and disasters , and the team behind Google Flu Trends . <p> Now , this important theme has been revisited at TED by Dr. Nathan Wolfe , founder of the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative ( GVFI ) , a new non-profit funded by Google.org and the Skoll Foundation . Dr Wolfe 's rousing message is that when it comes to pandemics , early detection in humans is n't early enough . We know that 75% of new human diseases begin in animals so to discover a pandemic before it devastates the human population , we need to catch new viruses when they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This mission has taken the GVFI team into some remote and difficult locations , from the jungles of Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo ( profiled on CNN 's Planet in Peril ) , to the wet markets of China and Malaysia .

Pass this on , and help spread ideas , not diseases ! <h> Monday 3/16/2009 05:51:00 PM <p> An interesting article making a case for the use of online information for earlier detection of disease outbreaks came out last week in the Canadian Medical Association Journal . The article , co-authored by HealthMap co-founder and Google.org grantee John Brownstein , looks at an outbreak of listeriosis in Canada and compares online search trends , news reports , and diagnosed case counts during the outbreak period . <p> Listeriosis is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada killed about 20 people last summer . By using Google Insights for Search data combined with HealthMap 's news surveillance data , the authors discovered that a specific search query provided even earlier indication of the outbreak than news reports . <p> So , what was that key search term that gave the earliest indication of the outbreak ? Listeriosis . That 's right , when the researchers looked at trends for people searching online for the technical term " Listeriosis , " they discovered that the peak of the search trend for that term was the same as the actual peak of medically diagnosed Listeriosis cases . The increase in online searches for " Listeriosis " began in mid-July , one month before the federal announcement that an outbreak was underway in Canada . This means that people diagnosed with Listeriosis , or others close to them , were likely to be the ones searching for that term online at the time of diagnosis , causing a spike . <p> In contrast , search trends for " Listeria , " the term used in the public announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement and other news reports in mid-August . Thus , people searching for " Listeria " were probably doing so in response to the press about the outbreak , not because they 'd been diagnosed . <p> Early detection is critical to helping health officials respond more quickly . While documenting the potential for using online info for earlier outbreak detection , the authors also recognize the challenges . This seems to be the tip of the iceberg for research in this area , and it has others talking too - check out the Wall Street Journal blog which calls this " a wonkier example of Google Flu Trends .

In the days that followed , a record number of volunteers flooded disaster response agencies , government agencies , churches and local outreach organizations with calls to find out how they could help . I was one of those volunteers and what I experienced changed my life forever . <p> Three years later , much of the region remains abandoned . Repair of city infrastructure and tourism ( the primary economic source for this part of the nation ) are slow and stagnant in much of the region . We will be successful in turning around these trends only if we come together and rededicate ourselves to this effort . As part of the Black Googlers Network ( BGN ) , 32 colleagues and I traveled to the region for what was initially slated as a Katrina Rebuilding Outreach Trip . As New Orleans slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side with the proud and resilient residents of this amazing city to help them repair the lives they 've worked so hard to rebuild , sending a clear message that they are not forgotten . <p> As our group planned to deploy so quickly after Hurricane Gustav , most agencies were still shut down because their employees were evacuated to other parts of the country . Notable exceptions to this shut down were two organizations to which I have personal ties - St. Bernard Project and The Idea Village . <p> St. Bernard Project is a nonprofit , community-based organization that began rebuilding homes in August 2006 ( boasting 177 projects to date ) that were damaged by flood waters from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in St. Bernard Parish , Louisiana . St. Bernard Parish is a working class community and was one of the hardest hit parishes of the city because of its location just 5 miles from the now infamous Industrial Levee . <p> The Idea Village is an organization working to accelerate the growth of the entrepreneurial community in the embattled New Orleans region . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch plan for their 504ward $200,000 business plan competition by employing our business savvy , creative thought processes and Google product knowledge .

The Idea Village 's motto is " Trust Your Crazy Ideas , " but I do n't see anything crazy about wanting to rebuild one of America 's greatest cities . <p> The highlight of the trip was that at each build site , the families whose homes we were returning to their former grace stopped by to say hello , offer their gratitude and recount the stories of survival . Andrea was the owner of the home I was rebuilding . She was the mother of two small children and was anxious to return a sense of normalcy to all of their lives .

Even with all of the progress made to get people back into their homes , communities are fractured and without basic services and business opportunities . <p> On the final day of our trip , we went to the Upper and Lower Ninth Ward , the areas most devastated by the hurricanes . The neighborhoods were absent of life ; there is little or nothing for residents to come back to . But signs of hope included children riding bikes , families and neighbors barbecuing on the front lawns of their homes ( many still tattooed with the post storm FEMA markings ) and a few bold projects such as the The Musicians ' Village and Brad Pitt 's Make it Right project .

Energy has taken center stage in D.C. during this short session before the October recess , and more than two dozen senators participated in the summit 's morning session alone . <p> Dan and other member of the panel stressed the importance of improving energy efficiency as the low-hanging fruit in the energy policy debate .

Fortunately , this debate has now been mostly put to rest with the release of the fourth assessment of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) last year , which stated : " Warming of the climate system is unequivocal.

This time the debate is not focused on attributing a cause to global warming but rather what to do about adapting to it impacts . Is improving management to current climate variability an adaptation strategy ? Or is climate adaptation more about developing strategies to manage the severe climate change impacts projected for 20-50 years in the future ? <p> Questions such as these arose in a recent workshop that Google.org sponsored in Kenya on climate and health . " Are we talking about climate variability or climate change ? " participants would ask during working groups focused on identifying strategies for reducing vulnerability to the emergence and spread of climate-sensitive diseases . <p> The crux of the variability vs. change discussion began when Phil Thornton from ILRI presented an overview of the state of the science on climate projections which highlighted the huge uncertainty in projections from the Global Climate Models ( GCMs ) out toward the middle and end of century . Then Caroline Kisia , executive director of Action Africa Help International ( AAHI ) and a medical doctor who works with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate science stuff is interestingbut it is not clear what communities are supposed to do with this information there is too much uncertainty to define any real actions here . <p> A few case studies were then presented showing how weather and seasonal climate projections have the potential for improving management for climate-sensitive diseases such as rift valley fever , malaria , meningitis and dengue . These seemed to be helpful , but how are they related to climate adaptation ? <p> These are all good points and good questions . It seems that Caroline was asking the climate scientists and health experts in the room to put aside their fancy models and labels and just focus on the community needs . <p> Communities today across the globe , and especially in Africa , have many needs related to managing the risks of climate and weather including floods , droughts , and climate-sensitive diseases . The workshop discussions highlighted the opportunities and challenges of connecting the climate and health sectors to build tools for managing these risks . <p> Ultimately , for the poorest regions of the world facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part simply about a heightened need for communities and nations to do what they need to do anyway in pursuit of sustainable development such as improve health services , develop drought-resistant crop options and diversify income sources . <p> Does this all then just come down to semantics ? At the community level it may be best not to worry about labels such as variability , change or adaptation . However , the implications of these semantics may be far reaching as policymakers to develop much needed climate adaptation assistance programs and face important questions such as who should pay for climate adaptation in the poorest nations where communities are most vulnerable to but least responsible for the changes underway ? And what should be paid for , that is , what constitutes climate adaptation ? <p> These are tough questions . I am optimistic that if we do n't get stuck on the semantics but keep our eyes on our goals we will find solutions to enable the most vulnerable populations to take the concrete actions needed to improve their health and livelihoods . <p> Rosemary Sang led a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons learned from the major RVF outbreak in 2006-07 where 155 people died . <h> 9/19/2008 11:36:00 AM <p> A guest post from our friends and partners at the Acumen Fund : <p> If you care about market-based approaches to poverty alleviation , then the Acumen Fund Fellowship might be a dream job .

In developed countries , SMEs represent half of GDP and two-thirds of jobs , but they 're largely absent in developing countries . Access to finance is a critical constraint , despite evidence that there are highly profitable untapped growth opportunities . It requires taking some risk . We saw this firsthand when we met Joseph Tackie in Ghana , an entrepreneur whose sales quintupled after getting a relatively small amount of seed capital . <p> The mission of EFL is to develop a screening test that could be a criterion for loans to SMEs . Because these businesses often lack formal accounting ledgers or established credit histories , it 's very difficult for investors and lenders to gauge risk or finance-worthiness of businesses . When evaluating developing country SMEs , financial institutions have little information to be able to make investment decisions or measure the trustworthiness of clients . Does she have a good track record at repayments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does she understand the market and how to run a business ? Evidence suggests information such as credit scores helped banks penetrate the SME market here in the US . <p> We hope the EFL test will address the information asymmetry and help entrepreneurs get their foot in the door at banks and investment firms . The test , a psychometric screening tool , will assess " soft traits " of psychological , social , and cognitive characteristics to measure a person 's entrepreneurial potential . Financiers can then use the information to make lending decisions . The test could be an initial step toward the goal of expanding profitable lending to the missing middle . <p> EFL is already working with SME financiers in Africa , India and Latin America to refine their tool through field testing and pilots .

Eric Schmidt and GE CEO Jeff Immelt discuss solutions to our energy challenge in this video : <p> As a South African medical doctor with training and experience firmly fixed on human health , I am continuously struck by the enormous challenge of communicating usefully across academic disciplinary boundaries in a way that allows the science to inform relevant , practical action . While the information on climate variability and change was fascinating , I still struggled to understand how and why this could have direct implications for the day-to-day work of someone like me . <p> Fortunately , the convening included several case studies designed to illustrate the real benefits of collaboration . First , we looked closely at the Kenyan outbreak of Rift Valley Fever ( RVF ) in 2006/7 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both humans and livestock , and carries an enormous economic cost . In late October and mid-November of 2006 , two early warnings were issued based on evidence of above-normal rainfall that could be detected using remote sensing imagery . Unfortunately it was not until weeks later when the first human cases were observed that the outbreak was recognized , despite the fact that several livestock deaths had already occurred . Although the climate-based warnings and animal deaths were both early indicators of potential human disease , these opportunities for intervention were missed due to communication gaps between the different scientific communities . It 's often said that diseases do n't respect national boundaries , but RVF is the perfect example of a disease that does n't respect academic boundaries either . As the Kenyan example shows , successful control of disease in humans requires collaboration with those working on environmental , animal health and insect science issues ( at a minimum ! ) .

Which sounds great , but if our country is , as some say , " the most generous , " we should ask ourselves a few questions : why are there growing numbers in line at food banks ? When will American people give as much per capita for international aid as the Netherlands , for one ? <p> Researchers like me live for tough questions like these . So now that the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana Universityand Google are tackling the issue of charitable giving and the proportion that is focused on the needs of the poor in the U.S. and on international aid , I expect my job to be very interesting for a long time to come . <p> Were off to a great start . Yesterday we released the first Center on Philanthropy/Google studyPDF which used data from Center household surveys about giving . Google executive Sheryl Sandberg authored an April Wall Street Journal op-ed titled " The Charity Gap " ( subscription ) using some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , we use data about the types of charities that people ( households ) give to and estimate the share that is focused on the needs of the poor .

" We estimate another 23 percent supports poverty-alleviation activities at other types of charities -- for example , employment skills training at neighborhood centers . There is still more work to be done to illuminate corporate giving , which is allocated differently than household contributions . In fact , one of the fastest growing areas for corporate donors is international aid , an area where Google.org has made significant commitments . <p> And we are n't done yet . The household surveys ask about why people give , so we can look at motivations , too . In one interesting contrast , we found in early analysis of another survey that nearly 6 in 10 people said they want to help people in need -- but nowhere near 60 percent of the dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shelter .

Her memoir not only brings to life the polio epidemics of the 1940s ; her descriptions take you inside the cocoon of steel she has lived in for nearly 60 years . The iron lung encases all but her neck and face . Inside the lung lies Martha 's inert body , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanical bellows sucking air in and out of the air-tight chamber . The six foot-long chamber runs on electricity and gives Martha her every breath . Something as banal as a power outage or a tripped circuit could end her life within four or five minutes . <p> And yet it never has . Everything about Martha tells you she is a survivor . She became paralyzed with polio just days after her only brother , Gaston , died from it . Her parents knelt down and made a deal with God in 1948 : If He would spare their only remaining child , they would dedicate their lives to caring for her . And care for her they did for 50 more years , until their own deaths . Today , Martha still lives in the house where she first got sick , a simple farmhouse just down the street from the Baptist Church in her town of 300 people .

Martha gets a visitor just about every day , and a local friend set her up with a voice-recognition computer which she uses " to travel the world . " ( She also reads four newspapers a day . ) The Baptist Church tapes its service every Sunday for her . The doctors make house calls . Even though polio seems all but disappeared in this country , in this tiny American town , they have n't forgotten it . How can they ?

The Millennium Development Goals call for reducing by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water . This goal was adopted in large part because clean water was seen as critical to fighting diarrheal disease , which kills 2 million children annually . Together with my teammates Edward Miguel , Jessica Leino , and Michael Kremer , I 've been undertaking field-based research to assess the effectiveness of water quality improvements in western Kenya . There is compelling evidence that provision of piped water and sanitation can substantially reduce child mortality . However , it 's expensive , which has led many poor countries to instead provide community-level water infrastructure , such as wells . But somewhat surprisingly , we actually know very little about how well these kind of investments do at reducing the diarrheal disease burden . Our research is intended to provide rigorous evidence on this question . <p> Our approach measures the impact of spring protection , a process that clears and seals off the source of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeping from the ground . Naturally-occurring springs are an important source of drinking water in western Kenya , but they 're vulnerable to contamination when left unprotected , particularly from human and animal fecal matter . A locally-based non-governmental development organization ( NGO ) is protecting 200 springs in Busia , Kenya over a four-year span , and they 've kindly let us tag along . <p> Taking E. coli as our fecal indicator bacteria , our preliminary analysis suggests that spring protection leads to large improvements in source water quality . Not all of these improvements translate to improved water quality at home perhaps 70% but recontamination during transport and storage may be less of a concern than is sometimes claimed . We 're still trying to figure out whether these water quality gains have led to child health improvements ; either way , our findings will help us understand the benefits of achieving the water Millennium Development Goal . <p> I should also mention that I 'm now a full-time Googler funny how life happens ! so stay tuned here for future research updates .

As a woman , I have n't been allowed into mosques , but I 've stayed determined to somehow get my crew inside of one to record the beautiful , haunting , beckoning sounds heard five times a day throughout Muslim neighborhoods all over India . These calls mingle with bad static , reverb , or a low hum over low-quality outdoor loudspeakers . A crude transmission , perhaps , but an unforgettable sound . <p> That day in Meerut , my camera man and sound man were in the neighborhood mosque while I waited outside , intently listening to what our camera was recording inside . A crowd started to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because of our jeep and the two women left alone in it . We were a curiosity . A diminutive man with a wide smile ambled up to our car , " May I kindly know , Madam , what you are doing here in our neighborhood today ? " He was paraplegic , with a steel walker around the front of his five-foot-tall body like a miniature Colosseum . His walker was very worn out , and was at least three or four inches too short for him in a way that made his back lean over and his smile look up . I explained our film . He keenly listened to every word and replied simply , " My name is Muhammad Gulzar , and I am a polio survivor . Madam , may I help you ? " <p> I 'm not a superstitious person , but I could n't help but feel as I drove away that day with his phone number in my pocket that all of my earlier failed attempts to film a call to prayer ( the first time we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masked the sounds ... ) had but one purpose : To lead me to this mosque , on this corner , to this polio survivor named Gulzar . <p> An educated and unemployed Muslim , Gulzar volunteered with our crew over the next two days and eventually opened his doors to us to film him . After two weeks of filming the effort to eradicate the disease in India , it was there in Gulzar 's home that we finally saw polio up close and personal . He was 24 years old , but in the privacy of his home he had to crawl like a baby . In public , he wore calipers on his legs , and his hands bore the calluses of someone who carries his own weight every day on a frame of steel . His family ( one of the most loving and supportive I 've known ) clearly makes every accommodation for Gulzar , but the realities of public life can be cruel . There are no handicap ramps into buildings , no adjustable lifts onto buses no way , I realize , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of India 's best and brightest , but how , I wonder , can Gulzar possibly get to a job ?

Considering many ideas , we talked about what it will take to finally eradicate polio in the developing world , and the role that philanthropy can play . Many of our parents remember what it was like to have polio in this country , and a few people in the States still reside in iron lungs . These generations are advancing , and it 's important that we not forget how horrible the crippling of polio can be to those who are at risk today . <p> The community of nations , health workers and funders have come very close to wiping polio off the map : in 1988 over 350,000 cases of polio were reported ; last year that number had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under age 3 in just a few countries India , Nigeria , Afghanistan and Pakistan .

Experts were asked to assess what solutions provided the biggest bang for our buck in areas that spanned politics , economics , and the environment . Google.org adviser Lant Pritchett authored one of the ten " challenge papers " on education , and I did one on water and sanitation .

In contrast to the research that Alix and I refer to , Whittington 's challenge paper is more pessimistic about whether water and sanitation interventions are the best use of scarce resources that are supposed to improve the lives of the poor . They base this claim mostly on the expense of the technologies they consider ( wells , piped water and sewerage ) . <p> In our review , Alix and I argue that a key reason that water services are not working for the poor is the same reason why other public services are failing the poor : a lack of accountability between providers , policymakers , and consumers that has resulted in bad management and governance .

Greater savings are possible if people use the information to buy a more efficient refrigerator or air conditioner , insulate their home , or take advantage of off-peak electricity rates . <p> The McKinsey report acknowledges that energy efficiency alone wo n't solve our energy and climate challenges .

@@13268990 @1868990/ <h> Tuesday 11/11/2008 01:14:00 PM <p> Like many Googlers , we 're fascinated by trends in online search queries . Whether you 're interested in U.S. elections , today 's hot trends , or each year 's Zeitgeist , patterns in Google search queries can be very informative . Last year , a small team of software engineers began to explore if we could go beyond simple trends and accurately model real-world phenomena using patterns in search queries . After meeting with the public health gurus on Google.org 's Predict and Prevent team , we decided to focus on outbreaks of infectious disease , which are responsible for millions of deaths around the world each year . You 've probably heard of one such disease : influenza , commonly known as " the flu , " which is responsible for up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year . If you or your kids have ever caught the flu , you know just how awful it can be . <p> Our team found that certain aggregated search queries tend to be very common during flu season each year . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and we found that there 's a very close relationship between the frequency of these search queries and the number of people who are experiencing flu-like symptoms each week . As a result , if we tally each day 's flu-related search queries , we can estimate how many people have a flu-like illness . Based on this discovery , we have launched Google Flu Trends , where you can find up-to-date influenza-related activity estimates for each of the 50 states in the U.S. <p> The CDC does a great job of surveying real doctors and patients to accurately track the flu , so why bother with estimates from aggregated search queries ? It turns out that traditional flu surveillance systems take 1-2 weeks to collect and release surveillance data , but Google search queries can be automatically counted very quickly . By making our flu estimates available each day , Google Flu Trends may provide an early-warning system for outbreaks of influenza . <p> For epidemiologists , this is an exciting development , because early detection of a disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new strain of influenza virus emerges under certain conditions , a pandemic could emerge and cause millions of deaths ( as happened , for example , in 1918 ) . Our up-to-date influenza estimates may enable public health officials and health professionals to better respond to seasonal epidemics and though we hope never to find out pandemics . <p> We shared our preliminary results with the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the Influenza Division at CDC throughout the 2007-2008 flu season , and together we saw that our search-based flu estimates had a consistently strong correlation with real CDC surveillance data . Our system is still very experimental , so anything is possible , but we 're hoping to see similar correlations in the coming year . <p> We could n't have created such good models without aggregating hundreds of billions of individual searches going back to 2003 . Of course , we 're keenly aware of the trust that users place in us and of our responsibility to protect their privacy . Flu Trends can never be used to identify individual users because we rely on anonymized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . The patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations of Google search users . <p> Flu season is here , so avoid becoming part of our statistics and get a flu shot ! And keep an eye on those graphs if you 're curious to see how the flu season unfolds ... <p> Update on 11/21 : The team just published an academic paper in Nature , the international journal of science , explaining the science and methodology behind Flu Trends . Check it out for more information .

The forum , now in its fourth year , is organized by Koji Omi , former Minster of Finance and Science and Technology of Japan . The dual theme of the forum was " returning to harmony with nature " and " innovation " . It examined the linked challenges of climate , energy , and water , together with impacts and contributions of the digital , biotechnology , and nanotechnology revolutions . <p> The new Japanese Prime Minister , Yasuo Fukuda , kicked off the meeting by stressing the need to make the transition to a sustainable society through science and technology . There was remarkable consensus in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest challenges we face . Science and technology helped humanity alter the face of the planet at an unprecedented rate , and human activities are now threatening the geo-bio-chemical systems on which all life on earth is based .

As a sustainable development professional , I have gone to environmentalist meetings with pretty much the same message for two decades . Then , however , I was preaching to the converted . Suddenly , mainstream leaders from government , business , and academia are now singing the same song . Al Gores film awakened an environmental consciousness in the general population , and it seems we have finally passed a tipping point !

Curious what it would be like to help a company based in a developing country address some of its most pressing strategic needs ? If your answer , like mine , is an emphatic yes , it 's not too late to apply for the Acumen Fund Fellows program , which is accepting applications until October 24 for its next class of fellows . <p> Acumen Fund , a non-profit venture capital fund based in New York City , invests in entrepreneurial approaches to reducing global poverty . In addition to providing capital , Acumen Fund offers management support to its investees through its year-long Fellows program . I joined the second annual class of Fellows in September to begin two months of orientation and training in New York . In the first four weeks of the program , the other Fellows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders , discussed case studies of businesses working in developing countries , participated in leadership development activities , and begun to research the businesses to which we have been assigned .

The IPCC , a joint project of the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization , was honored for its efforts over the past two decades to educate the world about climate change . Earlier this year , the IPCC issued its strongest statement to date , finding the evidence of climate change " unequivocal " and concluding with 90% certainty that humans are the cause . <p> In awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to leaders in the battle against climate change , the Norwegian Nobel Committee emphasizes that the problem 's effects go beyond climate , and extend to individual security and opportunity . In the award press release they state : <p> " Indications of changes in the earth 's future climate must be treated with the utmost seriousness , and with the precautionary principle uppermost in our minds . Extensive climate changes may alter and threaten the living conditions of much of mankind . They may induce large-scale migration and lead to greater competition for the earth 's resources .

Action is necessary now , before climate change moves beyond mans control . " <p> Al Gore has argued for rising to meet the challenge of climate change from a moral perspective : " The climate crisis offers us the chance to experience what few generations in history have had the privilege of experiencing : a generational mission ; a compelling moral purpose ; a shared cause ; and the thrill of being forced by circumstances to put aside the pettiness and conflict of politics and to embrace a genuine moral and spiritual challenge .

Nicholas Vordzgbe of City Wash launched his mobile car wash service using a highly profitable , environmentally friendly approach to a common activity . City Wash is capable of washing an SUV with just 2 liters of water ! His next move includes opening a point of service location and expanding his mobile activities .

Participating in the judging process , seeing the operations in action , and spending time with the entrepreneurs provided evidence that this is exactly what is happening . Participants from last year have become customers and/or suppliers of each other . Last years winner was a mentor to at least 3 of the winners from this year .

Back in 2008 , a team at Google dug into this behavior and found that certain search terms were good indicators of flu levels . We later launched Google Flu Trends to estimate flu activity in near real-time using aggregated Google search data , in regions around the world . <p> At the end of every flu season , we evaluate the performance of our model . Are our estimates accurate ? What worked well , or not so well ? Do we need to make any updates ? After the 2009 H1N1 season , for example , we updated the model to make sure we were providing accurate estimates . Since 2009 , the model had performed well at the national and regional levels in the US and no update was needed . <p> Flu Trends can help estimate the start , peak , and duration of each flu season--all important information for public health agencies . During the 2012-2013 season in the US , the model performed well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the model overestimated the severity of the flu . In January 2013 , after spotting the difference between our estimates and the percentage of healthcare visits for influenza-like illnesses ( ILI ) reported by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , we started to investigate the high estimates . We found that heightened media coverage on the severity of the flu season resulted in an extended period in which users were searching for terms we 've identified as correlated with flu levels . In early 2013 , we saw more flu-related searches in the US than ever before . <p> We evaluated several options to improve the model . Ultimately , we determined that an update using the peak from the 2012-2013 season provided a close approximation of flu activity for recent seasons . We will be applying this update to the US flu level estimates for the 2013-2014 flu season , starting from August 1st . A casual observer will see that the new model forecasts a lower flu level than last years model did at a similar time in the season .

The inaugural award is meant to celebrate success and provoke conversations about ways to emulate and expand upon the success stories honored . We are thrilled about this honor for CalCars and not the least bit surprised that their contribution to the field of plug-ins has been recognized by such a prestigious organization . CalCars founder Felix Kramer has been instrumental in evangelizing about the benefits of plug-ins and strategically influencing key decision makers about their potential to dramatically reduce carbon emissions . There is no doubt that CalCars has already made history with their role in promoting this technology and we are proud to be a supporter of the organization . <h> Wednesday 3/26/2008 10:12:00 PM <p> Posted Niki Fenwick , Google.org <p> With the price of gas topping $3.75 this week here in California , drivers will be pleased to learn about the official launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international competition ( with a $10 million purse ) designed to inspire a new generation of viable , super fuel-efficient vehicles .

This is big deal . <p> The ZEV Program , in short , is a regulation that requires major automakers to produce a certain number of ZEVseach model year in order to do business in California . Some of the credits may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hybrids and plug-in hybrids that include some advanced , low polluting components . The ZEV Program does not treat all vehicles equally ; it gives fuel cell vehicles the most credits , then pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids , followed by a host of advanced vehicles like hybrids . The ultimate objective is to improve California air quality . <p> Google.org has been talking with Board Members , staff , and stakeholder groups to understand their perspectives on the proposed changes to the regulations . After meeting with them , we decided there are five recommendations relating to the proposed changes that we will submit to the Air Resources Board . Our hope is that when approved and implemented , the ZEV Program will accelerate innovation and reduce air pollution by getting large numbers of vehicles into consumers hands and on the road . <p> 1 . Strengthen the newly proposed " enhanced AT PZEV " category to require a minimum capability to drive in pure electric mode for 25 miles to accommodate the commuting range of a majority of drivers and make the vehicles more useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 10,000 electric or fuel cell vehicles total from 2012 to 2014 , not the proposed 2,500 vehicles . <p> 3 . Do not allow the electric and fuel cell vehicles sold in other states to count towards the credits for the California requirement ; placing vehicles in other states will not result in the necessary net improvements in California air quality . <p> 4 . Maintain the credit sunset for less efficient , lower power hybrids ; the current proposal asks to extend these credits indefinitely . <p> 5 . Do not increase the credits for Neighborhood Electric Vehicles ( low speed vehicles similar to electric golf carts ) ; they are not driven like full-function vehicles that are the focus of the ZEV Program . <p> To learn more about CARB , the ZEV mandate , and what you can do , check out a more detailed post on our new RechargeIT blog. <h> 3/20/2008 10:20:00 AM <p> Posted by the RechargeIT Team <p> Power on !

Dr. Brilliant also noted the importance of using new technologies for genetic detection . We know , for example , that over two-thirds of all new emerging diseases are of animal origin . By collecting and analyzing samples at the human/animal interface , we can begin to discover new viruses and study how they are able to jump species . He also discussed vulnerability mapping , a means to identify hot spots at increased risk .

The PTC and the ITC are tax incentives designed to spur the market for renewable energy and are critical to financing a new renewable energy generation . The credits are currently scheduled to expire on December 31 , 2008 . <p> Speaking at a news conference at the Washington International Renewable Energy Conference , Dan Reicher , Google.org 's Director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives , said : " We are at the dawn of a green energy revolution that could fundamentally reshape the way the world generates energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to drive investment in clean energy and push these technologies out of the lab and into the mainstream . Policy makers can make or break this revolution . " <p> In a recent ACORE letter to Congress , over 350 industry leaders warned that a failure by Congress to immediately pass ITC/PTC extensions could jeopardize U.S. job creation and over 42,000 MW of planned renewable energy projects currently in development in 45 states . ( That 's an amount equivalent to 75 base load electricity generation stations and enough to power 16 million homes. )

The goals of the working group are to provide a platform for groups engaged in community forest monitoring activities - across continents - to share knowledge and experience . Equally important is for these groups to provide recommendations for the development of tools , methodologies , and common protocols . For example , the Surui tribe in the Brazilian Amazon is using modern technology to implement their communitys Surui Carbon Project . <p> This effort is n't isolated , as many NGOs and stakeholders support community-based approaches to forest monitoring for their efficiency , cultural relevance , and reliability . Community Forest Monitoring will play a role in the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ( REDD+ ) effort which aims to incentivize developing countries to adopt a low-emission path to development . In thinking about best methods for data collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection issues including usability , security , accountability , cultural relevance , and scalability . <p> These are all concerns that the team at Open Data Kit ( ODK ) , an open source suite of data collection tools , have fleshed out and iterated upon . ODK was born in 2008 as a Google sabbatical project of University of Washington computer science professor Gaetano Borriello . Borriello wanted to take advantage of Googles data collection tools : maps , visualization , databases and has said that his team saw a gap in mobile data collection . Thus , Borriellos team developed ODK Build , ODK Collect , and ODK Aggregate , mobile tools that have attracted thousands of users and dozens of active developers . <p> As ODK iterates and evolves , the Public Sector Engineering team is learning about the challenges and opportunities in mobile data collection and exploring how we can contribute to this space . ODK already gives users the option to visualize data in Google Earth and Google Fusion Tables , and we are exploring how to take advantage of some of Googles other tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily posted to Picasa , or videos to YouTube ? ) Its our goal to make sure that all meaningful data is effectively organized and made discoverable , accessible and usable . <p> Ultimately , community forest monitoring represents just one slice of the potential that effective data collection tools create . ODK was initially motivated by the needs of community health workers and has proven flexible enough to be used to track everything from human rights violations in the Central African Republic to water quality in Ghana . As the nature of scientific research diversifies and the volume of data collected increases , reliable , flexible , and lightweight tools will become more and more crucial . <p> What 's next ? As the engineering teams continue to work on improving mobile data collection tools , this working group will convene policymakers at the next workshop to discuss standards and best practices . " The greatest barrier is n't a technological one , but the challenge of leveraging this data so that communities can help ensure better governance for their forests , " says Niki Mardas , Head of Strategy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many other public data collection efforts , it will become the job of advocates and analysts to shape meaningful narratives and press for the change the world needs . We 're proud to be playing a part in this effort and we 're committed to working with our partners to transform data collection from a passive , closed process into an active and empowering one . <h> Tuesday 6/28/2011 07:00:00 AM <p> At Google , were committed to using technology to solve one of the greatest challenges we face as a country : building a clean energy future . That 's why we 've worked hard to be carbon neutral as a company , launched our renewable energy cheaper than coal initiative and have invested in several clean energy companies and projects around the world . <p> But what if we knew the value of innovation in clean energy technologies ? How much could new technologies contribute to our economic growth , enhance our energy security or reduce greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions ? Robust data can help us understand these important questions , and the role innovation in clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and climate challenges . <p> Through Google.org , our energy team set out to answer some of these questions . Using McKinseys Low Carbon Economics Tool ( LCET ) , we assessed the long-term economic impacts for the U.S. assuming breakthroughs were made in several different clean energy technologies , like wind , geothermal and electric vehicles . McKinseys LCET is a neutral , analytic set of interlinked models that estimates the potential economic and technology implications of various policy and technology assumptions . <p> The analysis is based on a model and includes assumptions and conclusions that Google.org developed , so it is n't a prediction of the future . Weve decided to make the analysis and associated data available everywhere because we believe it could provide a new perspective on the economic value of public and private investment in energy innovation . Here are just some of the most compelling findings : <p> Energy innovation pays off big : We compared " business as usual " ( BAU ) to scenarios with breakthroughs in clean energy technologies . On top of those , we layered a series of possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We found that by 2030 , when compared to BAU , breakthroughs could help the U.S. : <p> Reduce U.S. total carbon emissions by 13% in 2030 ( 21% with Clean Policy ) <p> Speed matters and delay is costly : Our model found a mere five year delay ( 2010-2015 ) in accelerating technology innovation led to $2.3-3.2 trillion in unrealized GDP , an aggregate 1.2-1.4 million net unrealized jobs and 8-28 more gigatons of potential GHG emissions by 2050 . <p> Policy and innovation can enhance each other : Combining clean energy policies with technological breakthroughs increased the economic , security and pollution benefits for either innovation or policy alone . Take GHG emissions : the model showed that combining policy and innovation led to 59% GHG reductions by 2050 ( vs. 2005 levels ) , while maintaining economic growth . <p> This analysis assumed that breakthroughs in clean energy happened and that policies were put in place , and then tried to understand the impact . The data here allows us to imagine a world in which the U.S. captures the potential benefits of some clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in harmful emissions . We have n't developed the roadmap , and getting there will take the right mix of policies , sustained investment in technological innovation by public and private institutions and mobilization of the private sectors entrepreneurial energies . We hope this analysis encourages further discussion and debate on these important issues . <h> Monday 6/20/2011 11:53:00 AM <p> Earlier this month , thousands of " hackers for good " gathered in more than 19 different global locationsfrom Berlin to Nairobi , and Sydney to Sao Pauloto participate in Random Hacks of Kindness #3 .

Instead , there are several good measures , each of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu activity emerges when these stories are examined together . One such measure is the CDCs influenza-like illness surveillance network ( ILINet ) which shows the proportion of people who visit a physician with flu-like symptoms such as fever , cough and sore throat . This network can highlight areas where activity is unusually high given the time of year but can not provide insight into the specific pathogens which are causing the illness . Another is the CDCs Virologic Surveillance which shows the proportion of people who visit a physician , get tested , and have lab-confirmed influenza . This network shows the specific strains of influenza in circulation but can be affected by changes in testing practices , making it difficult to interpret the data over long periods of time . <p> We collaborated with the CDC when designing Google Flu Trends and decided to build a system that would make estimates based on the CDCs ILINet data . Historically , we 've shown a strong correlation with CDCs ILINet data , typically with a correlation of greater than 0.9 ( or more than 90% accurate as compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Flu Trends is 72% accurate as compared with CDC 's Virologic Surveillance data . This does n't come as much of a surprise since the virologic data is telling a different story than the ILInet data .

Through our philanthropic arm Google.org , we 've been pushing for energy policies that strengthen the innovation pipeline , and we 've been dedicating resources to developing new technologies , including making investments in early-stage renewable energy companies such as eSolar and AltaRock . Smart capital includes not only these early-stage company investments , but also dedicated funding for utility-scale projects . To tackle this need , we 've been looking at investments in renewable energy projects , like the one we just signed , that can accelerate the deployment of the latest clean energy technology while providing attractive returns to Google and more capital for developers to build additional projects . <p> A clear windy day at the Ashtabula II wind farm <p> Were excited about this first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbine technology and control systems to provide one of the lowest-cost sources of renewable energy to the local grid .

The control systems for these wind farms are also advanced and dynamic , allowing for remote 24/7 monitoring and operation to ensure maximum turbine up-time and power production . A couple of us got a chance to climb 80 meters up one of the 113 turbines to see firsthand how the rotating blade motion goes through a gearbox to turn the generator that makes the electricity .

@@13269011 @1869011/ <h> Wednesday 3/31/2010 01:58:00 PM <p> We appreciate TechCrunchs early April Fools story but have no comment at this time other than to say that this has nothing to do with our exploration of marshmallows as an alternative energy source . They work for kids ; why not for data centers too ? <h> Friday 3/26/2010 04:04:00 PM <p> ( Cross-posted from the Official Google Blog to bring you information on other green efforts at Google ) <p> Tomorrow from 8:30 to 9:30pm local time , hundreds of millions of people around the world will switch off their lights and participate in Earth Hour , the largest climate awareness event ever held . As climate change will effect people on every continent , we think a united , global call for action to address the problem is needed . <p> At Google were working hard to be part of the solution for the climate crisis . A first step was pledging to be a carbon neutral company . Our web-based services run in some of the worlds most efficient data centers , we deploy renewable energy where viable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cant otherwise eliminate . <p> Even with these efforts , however , there remains an urgent need for clean , affordable electricity . To that end we have a team of engineers working to develop technology breakthroughs that will help make carbon-free electricity an economically viable alternative to electricity from coal . <p> Were also putting our experience with organizing information to work , so we can enable others to do projects in the sustainable space . We recently announced , for example , Earth Engine , a computational platform that enables global-scale monitoring and measurement of changes in the Earths forests . And were working with our peers through Climate Savers Computing to cut the power used by computers in half . <p> We also want to help you achieve your personal energy reduction targets . Most people do n't  know their own direct energy footprint , so we launched Google PowerMeter to give detailed , near real-time information about home energy usage . We also like to encourage everyone to set their computers power management to avoid wasting electricity when its not being used . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago when I was a teenager and living under their roof . They were often exasperated to find the lights on in rooms I 'd just left , and it took years for them to convince me that I could choose something to eat without standing in front of the fridge with the door wide open . The point is , I had to learn to become a steward of the environment . We can help many more people take steps toward better care of the environment , and make that learning curve easier to climb . <p> Turning off the lights wont solve the climate crisis , but its a start . Earth Hour gives individuals a simple , meaningful way to participate in a global call for change . As U.N . Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated , " Earth Hour is a way for the citizens of the world to send a clear message they want action on climate change . " <p> So I hope you 'll gather your friends and family and join me , and hundreds of millions of others , in turning off the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Tuesday 3/23/2010 03:07:00 PM <p> At Google , we are encouraged to experiment and tinker to see if there is a better way of doing things . We want to encourage others in the energy monitoring space to do the same . To this end , I 'd like to introduce our most recent strategic partner Microchip , which is a supplier of cost-effective , innovative products for the embedded developer . Today , Microchip will include as part of their developer demonstration environment the Google PowerMeter API library that we recently announced . This integration will make it much easier to create devices compatible with Google PowerMeter which means one can more quickly go from concept to demo to product . <p> The Google PowerMeter API is designed to work with a variety of energy monitoring devices - from utilities with smart meters , back haul networks and enterprise scale meter data management systems - to small embedded consumer devices that can send energy information directly to Google PowerMeter . <p> Google 's belief in open source also means that the Google PowerMeter API library is available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinkerers and makers are welcome to explore the code and use it in their products . <p> As we search for clean energy alternatives , it is important that everyone - from utilities to garage inventors - get a chance to try out new technologies and methods so that we all benefit from their inspirations . <h> Monday 3/15/2010 05:41:00 PM <p> Google PowerMeter now gives you the ability to share your data with others . What does this mean ? Everyone in your household can now activate Google PowerMeter on her own personalized iGoogle page so families and roommates can all track their energy consumption online together . <p> You can also share your data with friends or other Google PowerMeter users to get advice on your usage , compare trends or even strike up a friendly competition to see who can save the most . After all , how can you keep up with your friends , the Joneses , when you do n't know how much they are consuming ? <p> Members of the Google PowerMeter team routinely compare their energy usage data and share energy saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by comparing his PowerMeter data with his friend 's data during a heat wave , a fellow Googler discovered that his home air-conditioning system was consuming much more energy than his friend 's system . The friend lives in the same area and in a similar sized house . By sharing this data , the Googler found out that his air conditioner was malfunctioning , and after making the necessary repairs , was able to reduce the amount he spends on electricity for air conditioning . <p> All sharing is completely opt-in and your privacy will still be protected .

Our founders have set a goal of devoting approximately 1% of Google 's equity and yearly profits to philanthropy . In 2009 , we devoted around $100 million plus in-kind giving to a broad range of philanthropic efforts . Here are some highlights : <p> Academic scholarships and awards : We provide scholarships to encourage students of various backgrounds , ethnicities and gender to excel in their studies in hopes that these and other programs will help dismantle barriers that keep women and minorities from entering computing and technology fields . <p> Academic grants : We support the next generation of engineers and maintain strong ties with academic institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mission . We fund projects across a variety of subjects , host visiting faculty members at Google , and have launched the Google Fellowship Program to fund graduate students doing innovative research in several fields . <p> Holiday charitable gift : We made $22 million in donations in 2009 to a couple of dozen deserving charities around the world to help organizations that have been stretched thin by more requests for help in a year of fewer donations . <p> Employee gift matching : Google matches up to $6,000 for each employee 's annual charitable contributions and contributes $50 for every five hours an employee volunteers through our " Dollars for Doers " program to encourage employee participation in charitable causes . <p> Charitable Giving Council : We support grants for Googler-led partnerships on causes such as K-12 educational initiatives in science , math and technology . <p> Community affairs : We invest in communities where Google has a presence around the world , creating opportunities for Googlers to invest time and expertise , engage in local grant making and build partnerships with local stakeholders . <p> In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to free tools to help charitable groups promote their cause , raise money , collaborate with others and operate more efficiently .

Neil is touring the country in a soon-to-be converted 1959 Lincoln Continental Mark IV named Linc-Volt , spreading the word about plug-in hybrid electric vehicles ( PHEVs ) and vehicle-to-grid technology .

" <h> 9/12/2007 08:39:00 AM <p> Posted by Kirsten Olsen <p> Since Google.org launched the RechargeIT initiative in June as part of our efforts to stop global warming , a lot has happened in the world of plug-in vehicles . Automakers have made key announcements about future plans for plug-ins . Our grantee , the Electric Power Research Institute ( EPRI ) , along with Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) , released a comprehensive assessment that found that widespread use of plug-in hybrids could dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions . The charge for electrified transportation is heating up , and we could n't be more excited . But consumers still ca n't buy plug-in vehicles and that 's a problem . It 's time for us to put some money where our mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Today , Google.org has issued a request for investment proposals ( RFP ) to the tune of $10 million in order to advance sustainable transportation solutions . We are inviting entrepreneurs and companies to show us their best ideas on how they can contribute to this important cause . We need catalytic investments to support technologies , products and services that are critical to accelerating plug-in vehicle commercialization . That is why we have structured this RFP to offer investment dollars to for-profit companies to promote social and environmental change . The severity of global warming requires solutions from NGOs , governments , individuals and ( very importantly ) the private sector . We have already made $1 million in grants to a group of outstanding non-profit organizations , and want to expand our impact by spurring innovation in the private sector . While $10 million is a fraction of the total investment needed to transform our transportation sector , we hope this RFP will help catalyze a broader response . We need the automakers to bring these cars to market , but plug-in vehicles also need an entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of open call for proposals is not the usual model for investment , but we wanted to use a process that was open to new ideas and new entrants . Part of our goal is to get as many people as possible to work on solutions to our vehicle emissions challenges . We welcome and expect to receive submissions from a wide variety of companies -- from cutting edge battery technologies to innovative service businesses and from companies of all sizes . We also encourage participants from all over the world to submit proposals . This is a global challenge , and it will take all of us to solve it . <p> This open RFP process is a new approach to mission-focused investing , and we 're interested to see what we can learn from it , both in terms of opportunities and gaps that exist in this space today , as well as ways that we can improve on this solicitation process for future investments . Our focus on learning is the primary reason we decided to narrow this first RFP to investments in private companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We will continue to make grants as part of RechargeIT and other programs , but we 're excited today to announce our first foray into investments.To learn more , read the RFP . <h> Monday 9/10/2007 11:11:00 AM <p> Posted by Daniel Conrad , Senior Business Analyst , Google <p> Joseph Tackie is the CEO of Meaty Foods Limited , a high-end butcher in Ghana .

He told me about the progress of his business one year since his graduation . <p> DC : I heard that you quintupled sales in one month after winning seed capital from BBB last year . How on earth ? <p> JT : See , the difficulty of our environment is that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect you to have already made it , to have already become successful before they invest . They are not going to finance your marketing . With the seed capital from BBB , I was able to create a very good billboard . That 's all it took . People would see the billboard and come in and want to see what it was that we were doing . And our sales quintupled in just one month . <p> Three weeks ago I got my certification from the Ghanaian Standards Board . It cost a lot of money , and this is the type of thing that nobody will finance because they see you as a start-up . Now I can sell to any supermarket in Ghana.When you are a start-up , none of the banks wants to do business with you . But with a little success , now they are chasing you to do business with them . <p> DC : What are your future plans for your business ? <p> JT : First , we are developing our outlets . We have one store now , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We also have a request to set up a similar processing facility in Mali . They have lots of beef in Mali but no high-end processing . <p> DC : What did you learn from the BBB program ? <p> JT : What really made the difference with the program was the networking . Because the program is organized by entrepreneurs it is very practical . They are like role models . Your anxieties are things they have experienced , so you can share with them . <p> Working with entrepreneurs breaks down the fears and anxieties . Issues to do with risks are minimized . You are exposed to success . A lot of people are afraid to venture because of the losses they have dealt with . But working with other entrepreneurs enables you to look forward . The obstacles will always be there , but you will be equipped to go around them . <p> There have been a lot of people saying foreign aid is bad . But this is different . It is like you are teaching me to fish . This BBB program empowered me.

@@13269021 @1869021/ <h> Friday 4/02/2010 12:22:00 PM <p> The international community likes to define Liberias recent history primarily through two events : its fourteen-year civil war , which ended in 2003 , and the work of the countrys president , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , the first democratically elected female leader in Africa . The chart below illustrates both . On my recent trip to Liberia , first with a group of Bay Area philanthropists hosted by the government and then as part of a small group of Googlers on a country visit , I learned more about how terrible the 1980s and 90s were in this small West African nation . GDP -- a crude measure of the health of a nation , but an indicator nonetheless -- dropped 90% as the country endured brutal dictatorship after brutal dictatorship . That decline is the largest in any nation since World War II , and nearly twice the percentage drop that Rwanda , Zimbabwe , and other states experienced during their crises . The good news is that although Liberia essentially had no economy at the depths of the war , GDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and foreign direct investment has returned . <p> The numbers also tell a third story . Throughout the 1960s and 70s Liberias economy grew at a steady pace in a way that most other African economies did not .

The first day we reserved our car for 9:00am but when I looked out the hotel window at 9:02am I noticed the car speeding off with three other passengers . When I frantically called the driver he responded , " My man , do n't  worry -- I will get you to your meeting on time . " And he did . Then there was the night a local friend suggested dinner by saying , " Come on -- this place has a nice outdoor patio at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't  quite sound as inviting as I meant it . " When we arrived our waiter was Frankie , a cheerful eight-year old sporting an Alex Rodriguez Yankees jersey who delivered our food and drink on the jog . At the local family restaurant , everyone pitched in . <p> Like most of Africa , cell phones are ubiquitous in Liberia and are the technology of choice for the vast majority of the population . Our meetings with the mobile providers there could have taken place anywhere in the world . They 're making money but are fiercely competitive with one another , slashing prices and offering new products to gain market share , and desperately trying to expand into new markets like broadband . Their activities are far from philanthropic , but they 're arguably having a more positive affect on Liberians day-to-day life than any other segment of society . The mobile penetration rate is 40% and rising , particularly in rural areas where phones are often the first " big " purchase a Liberian will make . <p> The countrys trademark ingenuity is of course noticeable here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different mobile carriers and switch back and forth depending on coverage and prices ( a noticeably nice option that 's not available in the locked-down U.S. market ) . Since unanswered calls do n't  incur a charge and the person who initiates the call pays more than the receiver , Liberians will also occasionally call and hang up , meaning , " I want talk to you but you can afford this more than I can , so call me back . " Scratch cards , which give you twenty or thirty minutes of talk time , are practically used as cash and are sold virtually everywhere . <p> The past thirty years have been difficult ones for most Liberians , and with an 80% unemployment rate and known war criminals still occupying high government offices , there are still huge problems to address . In the next two years the country will hold elections and most of the UN peacekeepers will withdraw . Watch closely : if both go well , a stable Liberia may finally be back .

For example , in India , the poor often do not know what they are entitled to and what services are available to them . I recently attended an international conference on the Right to Public Information at the Carter Center and learned that there are approximately 70 RTI ( Right to Information ) laws in the world . However surprisingly , little has been done to evaluate whether these laws are accomplishing their stated and unstated objectives . <p> Access to meaningful information is critical to Google.org 's Inform and Empower initiative in India . To help us better understand how to make the Right to Information ( RTI ) more effective in India , we are delighted that Shekhar Singh who is an active member of the people 's movement for the right to information has agreed to conduct a study of the use and implementation of the Act across various stakeholders in India ( including public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corporate sector ) . The objective of this study is to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the Act , the constraints preventing effective implementation and the ways in which access to information affects people 's lives . <p> By supporting this study , we hope to generate awareness about the Act , explore the possibility of creating tools for Information Commissioners and other government officials to better use the information , and systematize the way RTI requests could made publicly available online or through other channels . We want to help RTI achieve its full potential and hope that this study will be a first step in that direction . <h> Monday 4/21/2008 11:34:00 PM <p> Posted by Shannon Oliver , Associate , Google.org <p> In the spirit of Earth Day , I took a look at how the environmental movement can foster job growth . Here 's what I found : <p> First , what exactly are green jobs and what can they do to spur the U.S. economy and stop climate change ? Simply put , green jobs are jobs that are good for the environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage . In a recent New York Times article entitled , Millions of Jobs of a Different Collar , the Sierra Clubs Carl Pope stated , " A green job has to do something useful for people , and it has to be helpful to , or at least not damaging to , the environment . " <p> Can the fight against global warming really create millions of these green jobs across America ? With worry about the economy on the rise , it is certainly a hopeful scenario . A recent article in the Oakland Tribune suggests that experts envision just such a future : " If global warming is to be slowed , it will take wholesale change in how electricity is generated , how people travel and how they heat and cool their houses . That means installing hundreds of millions of solar panels , building thousands of wind farms and geothermal plants , engineering new ways to derive energy from renewable sources and weatherizing millions of homes . Green companies are rapidly hiring new workers and indications are they will continue . " <p> For those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please check out my longer post on the potential number of jobs created by a cleaner , greener economy . And have a happy Earth Day ! <h> Friday 4/18/2008 01:32:00 PM <p> Google Earth is a great tool for exploring the world in ways never before possible . Many of the non-profits and other public-benefit organizations that we work with find it especially useful for showing people the remote places where they work and telling their stories in a very compelling way . <p> Have you ever looked at the amazing high-resolution images in Google Earth and wondered when the photo was taken ? Well now you can stop wondering ! Google Earth 4.3 was launched this week , and one of the many new features is the " imagery acquisition date . " <p> Simply zoom in on and move your mouse cursor over the high-resolution imagery ; the status bar will display the date when the imagery was acquired . This will be especially useful for organizations concerned about changes in the environment . <p> For anyone interested in learning more about Google Earth , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woof of Map Action has written a great paper ( 1MB PDF ) that you should check out .

I must admit that I did n't have much knowledge in this area and did n't even realize that the US passed the Freedom of Information Act ( FOAI ) more than 40 years ago . Today , roughly 70 countries have adopted legislation that theoretically gives their citizens the right to ask for and receive from their governments information on any number of issues , including property records , tax files , and identity files . <p> This may sound rather vague and unimportant . But in some developing countries access to birth certificates can be critical in getting access to basic public services like immunizations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when seeking loans ) . For the poor , this access is particularly important , but finding even simple records of identity can be much harder than you might imagine . The ability of bureaucrats to control access to what is " public " puts them in position to make all kinds of demands . For example , getting access to a birth certificate ( technically a public record ) can take months , involve dozens of steps , and include bribes at every stage . Without basic identify documents , the poor are often left without access to essential public services reserved for " official citizens " . <p> Governments increasingly are putting public information online , even in the developing world . However , " online " does n't always mean searchable or crawlable . In other words , you have to know where it is to find it . How would you even know where to look ? Participants at the conference were captivated by the idea of making high value , high impact public records like land registries and identify documents available online in a format @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in digitizing books and making them available online was cited as the kind of effort that could be useful in helping give people in developing countries access to the public information they need . There is some work already happening at Google on making government records crawlable . <p> The possibility is exciting . Could poor rural people get access to birth certificates , death certificates or land titles one day through their mobile phones ? It 's worth thinking about . Even if they have to pay to access them , the cost of getting access to critical data at important times would more than pay for itself . As the penetration of mobile phones in rural areas has shown , people are willing to pay for access to tools and information that give them what they want when they need it most . <h> Monday 4/07/2008 08:41:00 AM <p> Posted by Amy Luers , Program Manager , Google.org <p> The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has dedicated today , World Health Day 2008 , to raising awareness of the health risks of global climate change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're glad WHO and its member countries are using today to bring the linkage to the forefront . <p> Climates effects on health are wide reaching . Climate affects the quality of air we breathe and the quantity and quality of water resources . It affects the productivity of agriculture , distribution of pests and disease , and the severity and frequency of heatwaves , droughts , floods , and wildfires . As a result , climate change is not just an environmental issue but fundamentally a human health and livelihoods issue . <p> We are already experiencing the impacts of climate change across the globe . In fact , a WHO report concluded the climate changes since the mid-1970s may have caused about 150,000 deaths in 2000 . The impacts of climate change are disproportionately felt in the poorest regions of the world . <p> Change in WHO estimated mortality per year ( per million people ) attributable to climate change by the year 2000 .

Check out the post by our mapping specialists where they describe the Google Earth layers they developed with scientists researching the affects climate may have on dengue and malaria transmission . You can also download these Google Earth layers here . <p> While some climate change impacts on public health and the environment are now unavoidable due to our past emissions of greenhouse gases , the severity of the impacts will depend on actions we take today to both reduce future emissions and prepare for the changes ahead . At Google.org we are working to reduce greenhouse gas emission by developing utility-scale renewable energy cheaper than coal and accelerating the commercialization of plug-in vehicles through the RechargeIT initiative , while the Predict and Prevent initiative team is working to help prepare the world 's poor to manage the rising number emerging infectious diseases in our rapidly changing world . <h> 4/07/2008 08:32:00 AM <p> With the World Health Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climate change and health today , we wanted to show you some cool animated Google Earth layers that illustrate how infectious diseases may spread as the earth warms .

The Chevy Volt is a plug-in extended-range electric vehicle that operates on a combination of gasoline ( biodiesel , E85 , and gasoline fuels ) and electricity . Its large lithium-ion battery pack allows it to run only on electricity for up to 40 miles . Since 78% of U.S. commuters drive 40 miles or less from work , charging overnight can provide enough energy for most daily commutes . On longer trips , the car uses its combustion engine as a " range extender " but GM still expects it to get about 150 miles per gallon . According to GM , the Volt is expected to save drivers 570 gallons ( or $1368 per year , electricity included ) in fuel cost . <p> Googlers were invited to check out the Volt and ask GM representatives questions about the vehicle as part an effort to showcase different green technologies and educate employees about their potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug-ins in the coming years , and we look forward to checking out other models on our campus as they become available . However , we also hope to see commitments to a schedule of production from the auto-makers so that cars like the Volt will be more than just displays on our campus . Plug-in vehicles are an important solution for reducing emissions produced by the transportation sector . Of course , by reducing emissions , we reduce our dependence on oil . We are happy to see auto-makers working to make this solution a reality . <h> Monday 12/17/2007 08:25:00 AM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Team Member , Google.org <p> It came down to the 11th hour , and then dragged on for an extra day -- but after two weeks of negotiations , delegates at the UN climate change conference in Bali settled on a plan for reaching a new international agreement to fight climate change . The Bali action plan provides a roadmap for negotiating an expanded and strengthened international emissions reduction pact by the end of 2009 . <p> The deal leaves many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions reductions goals or targets ; in fact the scientific recommendations on the emissions reductions needed to halt climate change are relegated to a footnote . The plan simply lays out a process to negotiate the emissions targets to succeed the limits set by Kyoto Protocol , which expire in 2012 . It also provides a platform to begin talks to address growing concerns about adaption , deforestation and facilitating transfer of clean technologies to developing countries . <p> At the outset of this conference , we noted that the scale and complexity of the climate crisis demands collective action by the world 's governments . The Bali roadmap , while leaving much to be desired , represents an important step in this process . All the parties are still at the table and are now committed to spending the next two years crafting a more comprehensive global solution to fighting climate change . Many were hopeful that the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election in 2008 will help breathe new life into this process , regardless of whether the President-elect is a Republican or Democrat . <p> But given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how acrimonious the negotiations were , the rest of us ca n't afford to wait for the world to negotiate a new climate agreement . We need to take action now . Fortunately , many people around the world are doing just that . The numerous panels and side events at Bali were filled with examples of concrete actions people are taking now to build a cleaner future . We wrote on how the world 's local governments are launching their own initiatives to fight global warming and how others are working to ensure that any solutions take into account equity and justice considerations . Another hot topic of conversation here was the growing efforts of many companies to reduce their carbon footprints and take a leadership role in promoting smart energy policies . <p> The flurry of activity among all of these groups is encouraging . The result at Bali and the tough road ahead suggests that the international treaty process will not be sufficient to confront this challenge with the speed and scope with which it demands , at least in the short term . To stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether by making choices to reduce our personal carbon footprint , engaging with family and friends in our communities , or elevating the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda . For the Google.org team , it means a renewed commitment to putting our own resources to work . <h> Thursday 12/13/2007 09:15:00 AM <p> Posted by Kirsten Olsen , Project Manager , Google.org <p> Though all 15,000 participants of the UN climate conference have come to Bali to discuss the global response to climate change , there are many points of entry to the debate . Some enter through the policy door , seeking better rules to mandate emissions reductions . Others enter through the investment door , seeking profit from carbon markets and clean technologies . And an increasing number of participants come through the global development door , seeking " climate justice " for poor populations effected by global warming . As Meena Raman of Friends of the Earth International in Malaysia explained , " We all agree that climate change is happening , but now we have to ask the question of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how large that " burden of adjustment " will be is uncertain , but the UN Human Development Report released in anticipation of UN Conference proclaims that " climate change is the defining human development challenge of the 21st Century " and that " failure to respond to that challenge will stall and then reverse international efforts to reduce poverty . " The idea of climate justice comes into play when considering who will pay for climate adaptation when those countries that have done the least to cause global warming bear the greatest cost . Different groups here in Bali have even attempted to put a dollar amount to the cost of adaptation . Oxfam , for example , estimates the cost to be $50 billion per year and far more if emissions are not cut rapidly . <p> For many NGOs in Bali , climate change offers an opportunity to engage a new community of stakeholders and introduce ideas of environmental equity into the debate . Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , the Chairperson of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , described the phenomenon as a " moment to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesian Civil Society Forum for Climate Justice have sprung up in the past year to address the climate challenge while more established NGOs such as UNICEF have begun to incorporate work on climate justice and adaptation into their work . <p> Even though several side events and exhibit booths here in Bali focus on climate justice and adaptation , they are still a relatively small percentage of the overall NGO representation at the conference . Michael Dorsey from Dartmouth College and the Durban Group for Climate Justice points out that the International Emissions Trading Association ( IETA ) still dominates in Bali with 336 representatives making up 8% of all NGOs listed . That is equal to more than the delegation of Greenpeace ( 2% ) , the World Wildlife Fund ( 1.6% ) and Friends of the Earth ( 1.5% ) combined . <p> One silver lining that is gaining momentum here in Bali is the idea of " green jobs " created in the new energy economy . Most admit that further research on this topic is necessary to determine which sectors of society will benefit most from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice advocates in search for solutions . <h> Monday 12/10/2007 05:18:00 PM <p> Posted by David Bercovich , Project Manager , Google.org <p> The theme today in Bali perhaps could best be summarized by the bumper sticker maxim , " think globally , act locally . " While the delegates continued negotiations on an international climate change agreement , several events highlighted efforts by local communities around the world to confront the climate crisis and secure their own clean energy future . <p> Local cities from Milano , Italy to Betim , Brazil to Bhubaneswar , India shared their experiences deploying renewable energy projects in their cities . In partnership with ICLEI , they have banded together with other cities around the world ( ICLEI map below of participating cities below ) to share expertise and best practices on renewable energy and energy efficiency . <p> The U.S. Climate Acton Network highlighted efforts by U.S. states ( including 9 of the country 's 10 largest emitting states ) to reduce emissions , along with the pledge by over 700 U.S. mayors to meet the Kyoto Protocol targets in their cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Berkeley 's solar home financing plan ; Chapel Hill , North Carolina 's free public transit ; and the City of Austin 's plan to power all city facilities with 100% renewable power . <p> The flurry of local activity represents some frustration with the pace of international action , according to German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul . " We ca n't wait for every detail to be correct at the international level ; we have to act now and we can act now if we act locally . " Monika Zimmermann of ICLEI hopes the ' can-do ' attitude of state and local governments will be contagious . " We 're not just doing the right thing for our own sake , we want to prompt national governments and the international community to follow our lead . " <h> Wednesday 12/05/2007 05:59:00 PM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Team Member , Google.org <p> This week , representatives from 190 countries are gathering in Bali , Indonesia to begin framing an international climate change agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol , which expires in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activists , local politicians , NGOs , businesses and others -- responding to the call for action . <p> The talks come on the heels of a comprehensive assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) that presents the most sobering news on global warming to date .

According to IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri , urgent action is needed to combat climate change , or the consequences for the planet could be " disastrous . " <p> The good news is that the IPCC has identified a wide a range of solutions for curbing greenhouse gas emissions that are both technologically feasible and economically competitive .

It 's encouraging to see this growing interest in health as a part of the climate change discussion , especially given the WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . <h> 6/20/2008 09:56:00 AM <p> Posted by Meryl Stone , Associate , Google.org <p> A recent field visit took me to Kisii , a Kenyan town close to the shores of Lake Victoria . The population has swelled to 100,000 from approximately 70,000 largely because of refugees fleeing the post-election violence in other parts of Kenya . Local authorities expect to see that population double over the next ten years . Providing public services , especially water and sanitation , to this growing population is an enormous challenge . <p> In 2000 , the international community made a commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals to help communities access basic public services , like health , education , water and sanitation . One the key milestones of Goal 7 is to " halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 . " As of 2004 , the MDG Monitor shows the nations bordering Lake Victoria- Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya only 60% of their populations have access to improved drinking water sources . <p> While great progress is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60% of their population has adequate service , despite what the official statistics say . New water pipes have been donated to the local water provider . This has doubled the capacity , but it only reaches half of Kisii 's estimated population ( 50,000 ) . Water kiosks stand proudly along the main road . And yet , the taps run dry . The connections to the main line are not even functional . Young women still trudge the kilometers to the river , at risk to their own security , to collect water . Bright blue toilet stalls line the periphery of a girls school . While the school has seen an increase in attendance since the installation of these toilets , they continue to be plagued by their inability to deal with the sanitation requirements of their students . As we depart , the headmistress of the school pleads with us to help with the sanitation problem . <p> Some more recent data gathered from towns surrounding Lake Victoria in Uganda , Tanzania and Kenya , tell us a very different story than information from the MDG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us on the ground : while basic infrastructure ( water pipes , points , toilets ) may exist , those facilities are rarely functional , affordable or accessible , indicating to us that access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services is substantially lower than many think . Presented with this information at a recent UN-Habitat meeting in Nairobi , international donors and development agencies were astonished . They asked , " how come we did n't know about this earlier ? " <p> And yet , unsurprisingly , the people of Kisii have long known that they do n't have appropriate water and sanitation services . They may not have even heard of the MDG 's . They are likely unaware of the conversations that transpire amongst donors and development agencies and help shape where resources are allocated . They are having their own conversations about what they need . But who can they tell ? Who hears their voices ? <p> Our challenge going forward is to help amplify these voices and contribute to efforts to inform these local discussions . <h> 6/13/2008 07:35:00 AM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Google.org-Brookings Institution conference was punctuated by a panel moderated by Tom Friedman . The lively discussion covered topics including policy leadership , innovative business models , the potential for plug-ins to become greener over time , and the security and stability of the grid . Two important themes emerged the importance of plug-ins and clean energy for U. S. economic competitiveness and the policy and leadership needed to make this industry transformation a reality.Jon Wellinghoff , Commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ( FERC ) , surprised many in the audience by describing the 40 million electric vehicles on the road today in China ( many of which are scooters ) and emphatically argued that the grid is ready for plug-ins today . John Podesta , President of the Center for American Progress , credited Germanys feed-in tariff with creating a vibrant solar industry in Germany and causing the U. S. market share of the global solar industry to decline from 45% to 10% . Assistant Secretary of Energy Andy Karsnerannounced a $30 million Department of Energy investment in plug-in vehicle technology . Sue Tierney talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington at the state level and within the business community . Finally , Congressman Jay Inslee inspired the crowd by suggesting that we need visionary leadership on plug-in vehicles and renewable energy , likening the climate crisis to the challenge put forth by John F. Kennedy when he launched the Apollo program to put a man on the moon in 10 years . <h> Wednesday 6/11/2008 04:07:00 PM <p> Posted by Jenny Kwan , Climate and Energy Intern , Google.org <p> Hundreds of participants gathered today in Washington , DC as the Google.org - Brookings Institution conference kicked off . It was exciting to be able to see , in person , the latest electric car technology . <p> Outside the hotel we talked to Patrick from GM about their new Chevy Volt . If you look for it you can also spot the A123 car in the background . <p> Inside the conference room , I got to check out the latest Tesla . Unfortunately it 's a little out of my price range ... <p> I also met a bunch of people from around the US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Felix Kramer with CalCars who was one of the first to bring electric vehicles to Washington DC many years ago : <p> And Seth from New York and Lars from Sweden were here to check out the crowd and learn about the latest news and technology : <h> 6/11/2008 03:50:00 PM <p> Posted by David Bercovich , Program Manager , Google.org <p> On another day of record-high gas prices , the Google.org/Brookings Institution conference on plug-in vehicles kicked off in Washington , DC today . Electrifying transportation impacts our economy , national security , and environment , and conference sessions overflowed with interested attendees . The lively afternoon session highlighted the broad coalition supporting plug-ins and demonstrated that the technology we need to electrify transportation is here today . <p> Jim Woolsey passionately argued that our dependence on oil is a national security emergency and that countries like Japan and Brazil have demonstrated the potential to overhaul an automotive fleet in a short period of time . Shai Agassi described Project Better Place and their plans to rapidly deploy electric vehicles in Israel . <p> Several speakers , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NRDC study on the impact of significant deployment of plug-in hybrids , including the finding that our current electric grid could power 73% of our vehicles if we charged them at night . Peter Darbee from PG&amp;E talked about how plug-in vehicles could work with smart electricity meters to increase the efficiency of the grid . <h> Tuesday 6/10/2008 08:17:00 PM <p> Posted by Michael Terrell , Program Manager , Google.org <p> A new survey commissioned by Google.org shows that three out of four voters support an active government role in promoting plug-in electric cars and trucks . The poll of more than 700 likely voters covered topics ranging from knowledge about plug-ins to opinions on how the government should promote them . <p> Plug-in electric vehicles run like regular hybrid cars , except they have larger batteries , recharge from a standard wall outlet , and can go more miles with less gas . Some plug-ins are purely electric and do n't  need gasoline at all . Given today 's record-high gas prices and concerns about energy security , plug-ins represent a promising solution for reducing oil dependence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Poll data showed a majority of voters said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports federal efforts to bring plug-ins to the market , and more than 60 percent of voters are willing to spend more money to own a plug-in vehicle . <p> Over the next two days , Google.org and the Brookings Institution are hosting a conference in Washington , DC , " Plug-in Electric Vehicles 2008 : What Role for Washington ? " The conference will bring together Members of Congress , auto and utility executives , technologists , and plug-in advocates to spotlight plug-ins , examine their potential , and explore different federal policies to promote them .
@@13269028 @1869028/ <h> Friday 11/20/2009 01:02:00 PM <p> There are still power plants operating today that Thomas Edison could have seen with his own eyes . If he were to tour our electrical grid , he would recognize that too . As former Secretary of State George Shultz says , in energy " the past must not be prologue . " Can we reinvent our energy system in only ten years ? I think we can -- but we need to have a clear mission , we need to aim high , and we need substantial and sustained R&amp;D funding . <p> This funding , coupled with tax incentives , loan guarantees , and other market mechanisms , is needed to drive innovation across the entire R&amp;D pipeline -- from research , to development , to demonstration , to deployment , to full-scale commercialization . At Google we like to say , " from lightbulbs to lightbulbs " -- from the initial idea to real products . However you phrase it , investment is needed across that entire pipeline , especially from the government in the early stages where the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generate technological breakthroughs . <p> Since 1980 U.S. federal investment in energy R&amp;D has dropped by 58 percent . Back then , 10 percent of the total government R&amp;D investment was in energy . Today , the percentage has shrunk to only two percent . Recent signs in Washington are definitely positive . Earlier this year , President Obama added over $5.7 billion in 2-year stimulus funding for energy research , development , and demonstration . But this is n't enough , and it 's not sustained . We 're still on a 2-lane innovation road , not a superhighway -- and the road we 're currently on is headed for a big cliff . Unless something changes , we 're going to lose this significant funding after next year . <p> President Obama has called for $150 billion over 10 years for energy R&amp;D . Some experts go even further -- Professors Dan Kammen and Gregory Nemet at UC Berkeley propose that annual energy R&amp;D levels on the order of $30 billion will be necessary to address the climate challenge . And I was delighted to see recently that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund breakthrough ideas -- has made its first set of grants of $151 million for 37 projects . This is a great start , but it is only a start . We all need do our part to help convince our leaders in Washington to follow up on this down payment with substantial and sustained investment . <h> Tuesday 11/10/2009 09:46:00 AM <p> This year , it 's especially important to have clear information on what you can do to prepare for the flu season . With this in mind , we are happy to share a new feature for the U.S. which allows you to more easily find locations near you for getting both the seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccine . After expandingGoogle Flu Trends to a total of 20 countries and 38 languages , allowing more people to see near real-time estimates of flu activity , we began brainstorming with the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , their flu.gov collaborators and the American Lung Association on the flu shot finder and other ways Google can be helpful to people this flu season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ www.google.com/flushot . The same tool will also be available shortly on www.flu.gov and the American Lung Association websites . It 's important to note that this project is just beginning and we have not yet received information about flu shot clinics for many locations . In addition , many locations that are shown are currently out of stock . We launched this service now in order to help disseminate information about locations where vaccines are available , and also to make more vaccine providers aware of the project so that they can contribute . <p> Especially given slower than expected vaccine production , we think it 's important to bring together flu shot information in a coherent manner . We 've been working with HHS , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and state and local health agencies to gather information on flu vaccine locations across the country , particularly for the H1N1 flu vaccine ( both the nasal-spray vaccine and the shot ) . At the moment we have data for locations of flu vaccine directly from 20 states and counting . We are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all 50 states ; today , you 'll find results from chains such as Walgreens , CVS and PDX participants , such as Kmart , Duane Reade , WinnDixie and Giant Eagle . <p> Of course you should still call flu vaccine providers ahead of time to find out more about availability and eligibility for the two vaccines . <p> We hope to continue providing you with relevant information to help keep you and your loved ones healthy .
@@13269029 @1869029/ <h> Monday 2/23/2009 04:17:00 PM <p> When Larry and Sergey laid out their vision for Google.org , they hoped that this " experiment in active philanthropy " would one day have an even greater impact on the world than Google itself . They committed resources from Google 's profits , equity and substantial employee time to this philanthropic effort , and they created the mission : " to use the power of information and technology to address the global challenges of our age . " They structured Google.org so that in addition to traditional grant making , it can also invest in for-profit companies , advocate for policies and , most important , tap into Google 's strengths : its employees , products and technologies . At first I was skeptical about " going corporate , " but I came on board convinced that Google could make real progress on these issues . I think we have made an excellent beginning , but it is just a very few steps on a long path . <p> Now , three years after Google.org was founded , we 've been reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's clear that I am most effective in helping to identify " big ideas " and potential partners , as well as raising awareness about society 's biggest challenges . I am therefore very excited to become Google 's Chief Philanthropy Evangelist . I think this is the highest contribution that I can make both to Google.org and to fighting the urgent threats of our day : from climate change to emerging infectious diseases , to issues of poverty and health care . By focusing my energy outwards I hope to be able to spend more time motivating policy makers , encouraging public and private partnerships , and generally advocating for the changes that we must make as a global society to solve these problems . Long-time Googler Megan Smith will take over day-to-day management of Google.org , joining as General Manager to lead us through this transition , in addition to her existing role as Vice President of New Business Development . <p> One of the first things that Megan will focus on is how Google.org can best achieve its mission . During our review it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable non-profit organizations over the past three years , our greatest impact has come when we 've attacked problems in ways that make the most of Google 's strengths in technology and information ; examples of this approach include Flu Trends , RechargeIT , Clean Energy 2030 , and PowerMeter . By aligning Google.org more closely with Google as a whole , Megan will ensure that we 're better able to build innovative , scalable technology and information solutions . As a first step , Google has decided to put even more engineers and technical talent to work on these issues and problems , resources which I have found to be extraordinary . In this global economic crisis , the work Google.org is doing , together with our many colleagues around the world , to help develop cheap clean energy , find and fight disease outbreaks before they sweep the globe , and build information platforms for underserved people globally , is more important than ever . We stand behind the commitment made in 2004 to devote 1% of Google 's equity and profits to philanthropy , and we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our resources have the greatest possible impact for good . <h> Wednesday 2/18/2009 11:24:00 PM <p> Just one week after launching Google 's energy information campaign , we kicked off our first joint smart grid event with GE , a larger clean energy collaboration we announced last fall . Our timing was fortuitous ; the event took place just as President Obama signed an historic economic stimulus bill that includes $11 billion to modernize the electricity grid . <p> Getting energy information into the hands of consumers requires reworking the electricity grid to make it smarter . At yesterday 's event , hosted in Google 's Washington office , experts explored what the fundamental elements of a smarter grid should be -- from empowering consumers with information , tools , and choices to manage their energy use , to creating an open system that encourages innovation , to enabling a massive scale up of renewable energy sources and plug-in vehicles . We also explored the government 's role in accelerating these efforts . Our panelists were enthusiastic about the opportunity created by the stimulus , but also noted the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effective and efficient manner . <p> Historically such funding has been anemic . After a peak in 1978 of $7 billion , U.S. government funding for energy RD&amp;D dropped by more than 70% . Corporate RD&amp;D fell even more , and funding in the early 2000s totaled just 0.3% of sector revenue , compared to 15% in the biotech sector . Is it any wonder the energy sector has struggled to make progress ? <p> What level of energy RD&amp;D funding is needed ? Kammen and Nemet look at several different metrics and suggest that a sustained level between $20-40 billion is needed to reinvigorate the field . Recent activities push in the right direction : 2008 funding reached $3 billion , 50% higher than during the early 2000s , and the stimulus bill recently signed into law adds $3.25 billion in new RD&amp;D funding for clean energy . But to have a truly transformative effect , investment needs to climb even higher . <p> In addition , without emphasizing the " R " in RD&amp;D , we will produce only incremental improvements . We need to prime the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce radically better ( and cheaper ) technologies . This will provide long-term job growth , and also increase consumers ' buying power , stimulating the economy . <p> Funding must also be coupled with long-term demand for clean technology . This gives companies confidence their investments will pay out , and assures students entering the field that jobs wo n't evaporate . Research must also focus more on clean tech ; in recent years only 40% of energy RD&amp;D funding has gone to renewable energy and energy efficiency . <p> At Google we 've learned some that might be successfully applied to energy : <p> " Put the user first and all else follows . " For instance , customers care about saving money , but only if it 's easy to measure . Providing ways to cheaply monitor energy consumption is a powerful first step . <p> " Great just is n't good enough . " Cost-parity for renewables is required for long-term competitiveness , but to replace conventional technology we must develop renewable electricity cheaper than coal , the least expensive fossil fuel . <p> " Launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get new technologies into the marketplace quickly , then improve through iteration . <p> These strategies will make sure that the widest possible set of ideas are considered , increasing the number of breakthroughs . A " fail fast " policy would allocate people to the great ideas , with high-impact results guaranteeing continued funding , particularly at the critical demonstration stage where many technologies fail to attract sufficient capital . Carrying projects over this " Valley of Death " to full commercialization will ultimately result in the best , lowest-cost technologies rapidly reaching the market . For the sake of the planet , clean energy ca n't arrive soon enough . <h> Thursday 2/12/2009 01:06:00 PM <p> A guest post from Howard White , Executive Director , International Initiative for Impact Evaluation : <p> In the foreign aid business , it 's very important to answer the question , " Was this a successful project ? " because donors need to know where to target their scarce resources . Unfortunately , the answer to this question has frequently been , " Well it must be , we spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This problem has been most recently highlighted by the Centre for Global Developments report , " When Will We Ever Learn ? " . Billions of dollars are spent on development interventions each year with little evidence on whether they work or not . <p> I started my own academic career looking at aid impact at the macroeconomic level . In my own defense , I can say that , starting with my PhD , I criticized the over-aggregated cross-country regression approach , arguing instead for careful country-level analysis of macro impact that could pick up on both context but also the many channels both money and ideas through which aid affects development outcomes . Having published a couple of widely ignored books pursuing this approach , I became increasingly convinced that aid impact had to be examined from the bottom up . That is a systematic analysis of , if not all interventions , then enough to be able to make authoritative statements about whether the aid program is working or not . This might seem like a lot of work ; but then so is measuring GDP and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to implementing a bottom up approach . The first is that evaluation design is often poor when it comes to measuring impact . The second problem is that most agencies do not systematically compile evidence across interventions . It is symptomatic of a culture of producing evaluations as a bureaucratic requirement , not as a management or learning tool . <p> It is to tackle these two problems - the lack of evidence and the failure to synthesize what evidence there is into policy-relevant lessons that the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation ( 3ie ) has been created . Google.org has been one of our early funders . <p> The bulk of 3ie funding is going to help expand our knowledge about what works by supporting new impact studies , focusing on what we call the enduring questions of development . We are in the process of a consultative exercise to identify these questions to which you can contribute by visiting our website . We will also have an open window for studies on other topics , for which the first request for proposals went out recently . Please visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2/09/2009 09:07:00 PM <p> Imagine how hard it would be to stick to a budget in a store with no prices . Well , that 's pretty much how we buy electricity today . Your utility company sends you a bill at the end of the month with very few details . Most people do n't know how much electricity their appliances use , where in the house they are wasting electricity , or how much the bill might go up during different seasons . But in a world where everyone had a detailed understanding of their home energy use , we could find all sorts of ways to save energy and lower electricity bills . In fact , studies show that access to home energy information results in savings between 5-15% on monthly electricity bills . It may not sound like much , but if half of America 's households cut their energy demand by 10 percent , it would be the equivalent of taking eight million cars off the road . <p> Googles mission is to " organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed information about their home electricity use . We 're tackling the challenge on several fronts , from policy advocacy to developing consumer tools , and even investing in smart grid companies . We 've been participating in the dialogue in Washington , DC and with public agencies in the U.S. and other parts of the world to advocate for investment in the building of a " smart grid , " to bring our 1950s-era electricity grid into the digital age . Specifically , to provide both consumers and utilities with real-time energy information , homes must be equipped with advanced energy meters called " smart meters . " There are currently about 40 million smart meters in use worldwide , with plans to add another 100 million in the next few years . <p> But deploying smart meters alone is n't enough . This needs to be coupled with a strategy to provide customers with easy access to energy information . That 's why we believe that open protocols and standards should serve as the cornerstone of smart grid projects , to spur innovation , drive competition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We believe that detailed data on your personal energy use belongs to you , and should be available in an open standard , non-proprietary format . You should control who gets to see your data , and you should be free to choose from a wide range of services to help you understand it and benefit from it . For more details on our policy suggestions , check out the comments we filed yesterday with the California Public Utility Commission . <p> In addition to policy advocacy , we 're building consumer tools , too . Over the last several months , our engineers have developed a software tool called Google PowerMeter , which will show consumers their home energy information almost in real time , right on their computer . Google PowerMeter is not yet available to the public since we 're testing it out with Googlers first . But we 're building partnerships with utilities and independent device manufacturers to gradually roll this out in pilot programs . Once we 've had a chance to kick the tires , we 'll make the tool more widely available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with detailed energy information . And it will take the combined efforts of federal and state governments , utilities , device manufacturers , and software engineers to empower consumers to use electricity more wisely by giving them access to energy information .

In short , we are very excited about the grants we announced today , but we know we have our work cut out for us - watch this space ! <h> 10/20/2008 03:47:00 PM <p> Google.org has given the U.S. National Academies a grant for $250,000 to develop recommendations for U.S.-Chinese cooperation on renewable electricity . The 18-month study is being funded in collaboration with other U.S. sponsors and the Chinese Academies of Sciences and Engineering . <p> The study has three goals : <p> Assess the resource potential in China and the U.S. for grid-scale electricity generation <p> Explore near-term market opportunities for mature technologies <p> Recommend priorities for enhanced collaboration , with a focus on cost reduction , improved efficiency and grid connectivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their relevant agencies/ministries , and private industries assign priorities for meaningful cooperation in developing and utilizing electricity from renewable energy . <p> By focusing on grid-scale electricity generation , the study will give special attention to three major resources : wind , solar , and biomass . It will also consider technologies with longer time horizons , such as enhanced geothermal systems ( EGS ) . It will build on a current U.S. National Academies study , which is assessing the technology risks and tradeoffs for various energy technologies . An understanding of the geographic , technical , and economic constraints will help guide Chinese decision makers to develop appropriate strategies to sustainably meet their energy needs . Chinas manufacturing prowess , combined with its growing domestic market , provide opportunities to accelerate progress and reduce costs for renewable energy technologies . <p> The U.S. and China represent the world 's two largest consumers of energy . Getting renewable electricity right for both countries will be a significant step to decelerating global climate change . <h> Friday 10/17/2008 01:35:00 PM <p> Last month , Google.org invited the non-profits attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve their operations and enhance their websites . Romanus Berg from Ashoka moderated the session and Suzanne DiBianca and others from Salesforce talked about how non-profits can take advantage of the powerful integration between Salesforce and Google Apps . After a high-level plenary session , the 75 organizations in attendance participated in breakout sessions focused on technology solutions for improving internal efficiency , optimizing websites and harnessing the power of online video . <p> We also took advantage of the occasion to announce a refresh of our Google for Non-Profits site , now more streamlined and with a greater focus on training videos . Where appropriate , the groups in attendance were also given the opportunity to work with Google over the next several months to implement the ideas and strategies that work best for them . <h> Wednesday 10/15/2008 01:45:00 PM <p> Today is Blog Action Day , an annual event that rallies blogs around the world to post about a common cause . This year 's issue up for discussion is poverty , so we wanted to take a look at the relationship between access to information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right time in the hands of people has enormous power . As someone who works for Google , I see evidence of this everyday as people search and find information they need to create knowledge , grow their business , or access essential services . But that applies primarily to the rich world , where economies are built on knowledge and presume access to information . What about the poor and developing countries where people are offline more than online ? How do they benefit from the power of information ? <p> In much of Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , rates of economic growth over the last decade have exceeded 5% every year . Despite this trend , poverty in many countries has remained constant . In Kenya , for example , the official poverty rate was 48% in 1981 . According to the Kenya Poverty and Inequality Assessment released by the World Bank this year , 17 million Kenyans or 47% of the population were unable to meet the costs of food sufficient to fulfill basic daily caloric requirements . The vast majority of these people live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that impacts their daily life . Data on water quality , education and health budgets , and agricultural prices are nearly impossible to access . <p> Despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year on providing basic public services like primary education , health , water , and sanitation to poor communities , poverty in much of Sub-Saharan Africa persists . Where does this money go , who gets it , and what are the results of the resources invested ? That 's where we find a big black hole of information and a lack of basic accountability . How do inputs ( dollars spent ) turn into outputs ( schools , clinics , and wells ) , and , more importantly , how do outputs translate into results ( literate and healthy children , clean water , etc . ) ? <p> We simply do n't  know the answers to most of these basic questions . But what if we could ? What if a mother could find out how much money was budgeted for her daughter 's school each year and how much of it was received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often teachers are absent from school or whether health clinics have the medicines they are supposed to carry ? What if citizens could access and report on basic information to determine value for money as tax payers ? <p> The work of SODNET in Kenya is illustrative . They are developing a simple budget-tracking tool that allows citizens to track the allocation , use , and ultimate result of government funds earmarked for infrastructure projects in their districts . The tool is intended to create transparency in the use of tax revenues and answer the simple question : Are resources reaching their intended beneficiaries ? Using tools like maps , they are able to overlay information that begins to tell a compelling story . <p> Google.orgs role , through our partners in East Africa and India , is to support , catalyze , and widely disseminate this kind of information to public , private , and civil society stakeholders that can use it to see more clearly what 's working , what 's broken and what are potential solutions . Leveraging platforms like Google Earth and Google Maps can help organizations disseminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was once invisible . Once information is visible , widely known , and easy to understand , we are betting that governments and citizens will pay more attention to leakages in the service delivery pipeline and feel empowered to propose solutions . <p> You ca n't change what you cant see . The power to know plus the power to act on what you know is the surest way to achieve positive social change from the bottom up . And when we consider the magnitude of resources invested in delivering public services each year , a 10% improvement globally would exceed the value of all foreign aid . We believe that is a bet worth making . <h> Friday 10/10/2008 11:58:00 AM <p> This week the Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) released a report , The Deadly Dozen : Wildlife Diseases in the Age of Climate Change , which lists 12 pathogens ( including Avian Influenza , Cholera , Ebola , Lyme Disease , and Yellow fever ) that are expected to spread as a result of continued climate change . WCS highlights that the spread of this deadly dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cascading effects on the global economy . But , the report does not leave us in the dead zone . It points to how monitoring wildlife and the ecosystems in which they live can help us to manage these emergent human health threats . <p> This report , which draws from a new book , is just one of a series of new interdisciplinary studies ( others can be found here , here , and here ) that call for more proactive and holistic ( " One Health " ) approaches to management of emerging infectious diseases . " One Health " integrates human , animal and ecosystem health . <p> We are beginning to see public health training and disease management programs integrate animal health ( often with a focus on livestock ) into their plans . However , much less action has been taken to integrate ecosystem factors into disease management . This is not surprising given that integrating animal health into the human public health systems , although a large step institutionally , is a relatively small step conceptually . Many of the same tools and methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as surveillance , vaccination , and laboratory diagnostics . <p> In contrasts , linking ecosystem health including wildlife and wildlands-- and the risks of regional and global environmental change with the public health system requires a large conceptual leap . Traditionally , " environmental health " focuses on managing the health implications of pollution , toxics and occupational health . However , the environmental changes we are experiencing today , such as climate change , deforestation and biodiversity loss are fundamentally different types of problems . They entail disruptive systemic changes in underlying function of the systems . Managing the health implications of these systematic changes such as WCSs Deadly Dozen will require the conceptual leap of transforming our public health infrastructure to a one health infrastructure . <h> Thursday 10/09/2008 05:22:00 PM <p> When I arrived in Dar es Salaam , I was greeted with a warm smile and a " Karibu sana " -- " You are welcomed " in Swahili -- that set the tone for my visit to Tanzania . <p> I attended the Annual General &amp; Scientific Meeting of the INDEPTH Network . INDEPTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collecting data on nearly every aspect of the lives of a surveyed population -- on infectious disease , cause of deaths , migration , health service utilization , livelihood , reproductive health , and more -- across 37 sites in 19 countries in Africa , Asia , Central America and Oceania . For one of the surveillance site in Matlab , a rural area about 70 kilometres southeast of Dhaka the capital of Bangladesh , data collection has been taking place for over 40 years now . Data has been used to evaluate disease patterns and trends and also to test health interventions . In total , 2.2 million people every year are being monitored -- this provides required health and demographic data that enable developing countries to set evidence-based health priorities and policies . <p> Not surprisingly , data sharing within and across field sites and countries presents significant challenges to data management due to uncertainty in data access , poor metadata , and disparate data quality standards . Some of these issues and challenges were discussed during a session on technological innovations . Of particular interest was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis within and across sites in Burkina Faso , India , Papua New Guinea , Tanzania , and Thailand . We also learned about projects in Uganda and Bangladesh piloting the use of mobile survey software for data collection one of the sites was collecting 29,000 forms a year . Another point that piqued my interest was the concept of a " Health System Observatory " operating at different levels that would foster research discovery , innovation , and interactions between researchers , policy-makers , and other communities . <p> A concrete next step for me is to explore the possibility of leveraging INDEPTH capabilities to investigate the impact of ecology , climate , and socioeconomic change on the transmission of infectious diseases for more targeted control activities at local level . <h> Wednesday 10/01/2008 10:33:00 AM <p> Right now the U.S. has a very real opportunity to transform our economy from one running on fossil fuels to one largely based on clean energy . We are developing the technologies and know-how to accomplish this . We can build whole new industries and create millions of new jobs . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at home . We can improve our national security . And we can put a big dent in climate change . With strong leadership we could be moving forward on an aggressive but realistic timeline and an approach that balances costs with real economic gains . <p> The energy team at Google has been crunching the numbers to see how we could greatly reduce fossil fuel use by 2030 . Our analysis , led by Jeffery Greenblatt , suggests a potential path to weaning the U.S. off of coal and oil for electricity generation by 2030 ( with some remaining use of natural gas as well as nuclear ) , and cutting oil use for cars by 40% . Al Gore has issued a challenge that is even more ambitious , getting us to carbon-free electricity even sooner . We hope the American public pushes our leaders to embrace it . T. Boone Pickens has weighed in with an interesting plan of his own to massively deploy wind energy , among other things . Other plans have also been developed in recent years that merit attention . <p> Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2030 proposal is to stimulate debate and we invite you to take a look and comment - or offer an alternative approach if you disagree . With a new Administration and Congress - and multiple energy-related imperatives - this is an opportune , perhaps unprecedented , moment to move from plan to action . <p> Over 22 years this plan could generate billions of dollars in savings and help create millions of green jobs . Many of these high quality , good-paying jobs will be in today 's coal and oil producing states . <p> To get there we need immediate action on three fronts : <p> ( 1 ) Reduce demand by doing more with less <p> We should start with the low-hanging fruit by reducing energy demand through energy efficiency -- adopting technologies and practices that allow us to do more with less . At Google , we 've seen the benefits of this approach . We identified $5M in building efficiency investments with a 2.5 year payback . We 've also designed our own data centers to run more efficiently , and we believe they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personal computers can also become much more efficient . A typical desktop PC wastes nearly half the power it consumes . Last year , Bill Weihl , our Green Energy Czar , worked with industry partners to create the Climate Savers Computing Initiative to raise energy efficiency standards for personal computers and servers . If we meet our goals , these standards will cut energy consumption by the equivalent of 10-20 coal-fired power plants by 2010 . <p> Government can have a big impact on achieving greater efficiency . California 's aggressive building codes , efficiency standards and utility programs have helped the state keep per-capita energy use flat for years , while consumption in much of the rest of the country has grown significantly . Enacting similar policies at the national level would help even more . <p> We also need to give the American people opportunities to be more efficient . The way we buy electricity today is like going to a store without seeing prices : we pick what we want , and receive an unintelligible bill at the end of the month . When homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that energy use typically drops . Google is looking at ways that we can use our information technology and our reach to help increase awareness and bring better , real-time information to consumers . <p> ( 2 ) Develop renewable energy that is cheaper than coal ( RE&lt;C ) <p> Googles data centers draw from a U.S. electricity grid that relies on coal for 50% of its power . We want to help catalyze the development of renewable energy that is price competitive with coal . At least three technologies show tremendous promise : wind , solar thermal , and advanced geothermal . Each of these is abundant and , when combined , could supply energy in virtually every region of the U.S. <p> This year Google has invested over $45 million in startup companies with breakthrough wind , solar and geothermal technologies through our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal ( RE&lt;C ) initiative , but that is a drop when we need a flood . We need to unleash massive private investment in clean energy . The government can have a big impact here as well . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid deployment and scaling of clean technologies such as long-term tax support and a national renewable energy standard . Tax credits for wind and solar have lapsed several times in the last 20 years , starving these nascent industries of the capital they need to truly enter the mainstream . <p> We also must work both sides of the RE&lt;C equation . Progress will be accelerated when the price of carbon reflects its true costs to society . Putting a price on carbon through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax would help address this . <p> ( 3 ) Electrify transportation and re-invent our electric grid <p> Imagine driving a car that uses no gas and is less expensive to recharge than buying a latte . A " smart grid " allows you to charge when electricity is cheap , and maybe even make some money by selling unused power back to the grid when it 's needed . Plug-in cars are on their way , with GM , Toyota and other manufacturers planning introductions in the next two years . At Google we have a small fleet of Toyota Prius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our RechargeIT program . The converted Prius plug-ins get over 90 MPG , and the Escapes close to 50 MPG . However to successfully put millions of plug-in cars on the road and and fuel them with green electricity , we need a smart grid that manages when we charge and how we 're billed . A smart grid could also provide for the two-way flow of electricity , as well as large-scale integration of intermittent solar and wind energy . Much of the technology in our current electrical grid was developed in the 60s and is wasteful and not very smart . We are partnering with GE to help accelerate the development of the smart grid and support building new transmission lines to harness our nation 's vast renewable energy resources . <p> We see a huge opportunity for the nation to confront our energy challenges . In the process we will stimulate investment , create jobs , empower consumers and , by the way , help address climate change .

Based on this finding , we launched Google Flu Trends to provide timely estimates of flu activity in 28 countries . Since then , we 've seen a number of other researchersincluding our very ownuse search activity data to estimate other real world activities . <p> However , tools that provide access to search data , such as Google Trends or Google Insights for Search , werent designed with this type of research in mind . Those systems allow you to enter a search term and see the trend ; but researchers told us they want to enter the trend of some real world activity and see which search terms best match that trend .

Using Correlate , you can upload your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity best corresponds with that real world trend .

What 's interesting is that the ups and downs of web search activity for cell biology terms is unique enough that searching on Correlate for ribosome brings up searches for other biology terms , such as mitochondria .

@@13269035 @1869035/ <h> Wednesday 5/20/2009 12:01:00 AM <p> Earlier this year I blogged about energy information and a tool our engineers developed called Google PowerMeter , a Google gadget that can show consumers their personal electricity consumption right on a home computer . Our software relies on " smart meters " ( or other metering devices ) as a data source . Over the past several months we 've been looking to partner with utilities that are installing ( or have already installed ) this equipment in their customers ' homes . We 're energized by our very first Google PowerMeter partners : <p> Our initial partners include utilities with millions of customers as well as smaller ones . They are rural and urban , privately held and municipally run . Some are in the United States , others in Canada and India . They all have one thing in common a desire to serve their customers by providing access to detailed information that helps save energy and money . For now , Google PowerMeter is only available to a limited group of customers , but we plan to expand our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading the charge to make the electricity grid smarter and we look forward to working with them and others . <p> In addition to utilities , we 're also seeking partnerships with companies that can enable the implementation of our software . Our first such partner is Itron , a leading meter and data management company that serves over 8,000 utilities and is helping some of their customers , including San Diego Gas &amp; Electric , integrate with Google PowerMeter . If you 're a utility or company with a smart meter project that might be interested in plugging in to our efforts , visit our website for more information . <h> 5/13/2009 03:00:00 PM <p> As we blogged last summer , there are lots of experiments running on Google web search all over the world . Today we 've started a temporary experiment that some people might find interesting : we 're researching how Google users search the Internet when they or someone they know is feeling sick . <p> Understanding how people search when they 're feeling sick is an important problem to solve , as it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggregated search data to detect influenza epidemics . Statistics gathered in this experiment may also help Google deliver more relevant search results in the future . For example , someone who searches for arthritis pain to understand why an aging parent is experiencing joint pain might want to learn about nearby health facilities and potential treatments , whereas somebody who searches for arthritis pain because she is doing a research project might want results about how common arthritis is and what its risk factors are . Rather than make educated guesses about how many users are searching because they 're sick , we 're running this experiment to collect real statistics . This is not a permanent change , but a short-term experiment . A small percentage of random health-related searches will trigger the poll question . <p> For example , at the bottom of the search results for headache , some users will see a survey which asks whether they were searching because they or someone they know has a headache : <p> Similarly , if you happen to search for ibuprofen , a common anti-inflammatory drug , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you or somebody you know is taking ibuprofen : <p> Data collected in this survey will be aggregated across thousands of users . Survey responses will be stored together with the original search query , but will not be associated with email addresses or other personally identifiable information . Survey data will not be used for advertising it will only be used to help Google improve health-related search results and to help refine public health trends based on aggregated search queries , much like Google Flu Trends .

We can even aggregate energy savings from appliances and electronic equipment from thousands of homes to avoid the need to build new power plants . <p> Using the stimulus to invest in the electricity grid can help accelerate this transformation , while in the process creating jobs and helping to diversify our energy supply . Most importantly , these investments can help consumers and businesses save energy and money . We feel it 's important for the country not to miss this opportunity .

The topic for the evening was " Partnership for the Earth : Strategies and Solutions for Energy Security . " Eric spoke about Google 's Clean Energy 2030 plan and the importance of rebuilding America 's energy infrastructure . <p> The speech was followed by a panel discussion featuring Frances Beinecke , President of the Natural Resources Defense Council , Ralph Cavanaugh , co-director of NRDC 's energy program , and Dan Reicher , Director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives at Google.org. <h> 11/24/2008 08:59:00 AM <p> Having been in Africa for the past several months , I am beginning to see firsthand how access to information by regular citizens is starting to transform the continent . A single newspaper could be read by as many as 10 people , citizens are willing to rent-a-paper , and FM radio stations are exploding in communities where people are hungry for news , entertainment , and opportunities to make their voices heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . With mobile phone penetration growing everyday and airtime prices falling , people are communicating more than ever before , sending text messages and calling in to radio talk shows . They are expressing their views , sharing their opinions with each other , and communicating their delight or displeasure with government , business , and civil actors in more informed ways . <p> In East Africa in particular , people are bracing themselves for the broadband revolution . Within 12 months , initiatives like Seacom and EasyCom are likely to be active in the region and will connect people in completely new ways . What will happen when the super-highways open their gates ? Will traffic flow in one direction or two ? Will East Africans become net consumers or producers of information ? <p> Last week , Kenya held its first " content " conference arranged by the national ICT Board . Public and private people had plenty to say about " local content " and why it mattered . What started as a technical discussion about connectivity quickly turned to issues of national pride , language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures . While Kenyans clearly yearn to be part of the global community and consume information far beyond their borders , they also want to be heard , recognized , and contribute to global conversations . They want their news , their music , their issues , and their voices to find a place in the online universe . <p> Today , Swahili books online for example , number in the hundreds compared to the hundreds of millions of books in English available online . What message does this send to young people about the relative importance of their knowledge , language , and culture ? Fortunately , Google translation tools are beginning to address this challenge and launching search in Swahili is creating the right incentives to put more content online . But what else will it take to create symmetry between the number of people who speak a given language and content available to them ? <p> The good news is that there is no paucity of African content in the offline world . Africa is home to some of the worlds richest musical traditions , oral histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is that mobile phones are likely to be gateways to the internet in much of the continent . The challenge is how to migrate this wealth of content from the offline to the online world . If Africans are going to get online en masse , they need a reason to go there and they need to see themselves , their values , and their stories when looking through the online prism . With the availability of Google MapMaker in Africa , were already seeing that people are creating their own content and populating base maps with layers that are meaningful and useful to them . That is exciting . Whether its stories , pictures , or data on budgets and literacy rates , I hope we can give people a stake and a reason to get online and participate in the information society . <h> Thursday 11/20/2008 01:27:00 PM <p> With a new President and Congress , we have an unprecedented opportunity to transform our fossil fuel economy to one based largely on clean energy , while creating millions of jobs in the process . <p> Last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. can dramatically scale up renewable energy , become smarter about how we use energy , and deploy millions of plug-in electric cars . Our energy team has continued crunching the numbers and just posted new data on job creation and cost savings on our knol . We 'll keep updating the information and encourage everyone to take a look and comment - and offer alternative approaches if you disagree . <p> Reaching the goals of Clean Energy 2030 will require a comprehensive effort by the new President and Congress . At a minimum , we believe it should include putting a price on carbon emissions , setting national energy efficiency and renewable energy goals , and modernizing our electricity grid . With the right policies , we can drive trillions of dollars of new investment in clean energy and create millions of new jobs . <p> Stimulating the economy and creating jobs will be the first item of business when the new President and Congress take office in January . We hope that clean energy will be front and center . In its last effort to address the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , but much more needs to be done . Here are some ideas on how to advance clean energy as part of a stimulus package : <p> Get money flowing to renewable energy . Many wind and solar project developers cant take advantage of the renewable tax credits that were just extended . The continuing economic decline has wiped out profits in many companies - and the otherwise expected tax liability that credits offset . Congress should make changes , such as making the credits refundable , to make it possible for investors to get the value Congress intended . <p> Start building a smarter electricity grid . The last large energy bill passed in 2007 authorized , but did not fund , matching grants and demonstration programs to encourage investment in a " smart " electricity grid . These programs should be fully funded and expanded so more consumers have the opportunity to better monitor and control their electricity use and reduce their bills . A new Department of Energy ( DOE ) sponsored book explaining smart grid describes it as " the internet brought to our electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient . The DOE has a Weatherization Assistance Program that enables low-income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient . On average , weatherization reduces households ' heating bills by about 30% . President-elect Obama adopted our proposal to weatherize one million low income homes per year for the next 10 years . Current federal weatherization funding supports barely 10% of that number . A roughly $3 billion appropriation would weatherize roughly one million homes . <p> Green the Government . The U.S. government is the largest consumer of electricity . Accordingly , federal departments and agencies should lead by example when it comes to stimulating the economy through expanded energy efficiency efforts and increased use of clean energy . In addition , the Congress and the President can provide support to State and local governments for efficiency and smart grid projects ; the purchase of renewable power ; and converting vehicle fleets to low-emission vehicles , particularly plug-in electric cars and trucks . Such concerted government action will speed the advent of a new era of energy security and domestic job creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and improve energy security .

Whether you 're interested in U.S. elections , today 's hot trends , or each year 's Zeitgeist , patterns in Google search queries can be very informative . Last year , a small team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond simple trends and accurately model real-world phenomena using patterns in search queries . After meeting with the public health gurus on Google.org 's Predict and Prevent team , we decided to focus on outbreaks of infectious disease , which are responsible for millions of deaths around the world each year . You 've probably heard of one such disease : influenza , commonly known as " the flu , " which is responsible for up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year . If you or your kids have ever caught the flu , you know just how awful it can be . <p> Our team found that certain aggregated search queries tend to be very common during flu season each year . We compared these aggregated queries against data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , and we found that there 's a very close relationship between the frequency of these search queries and the number of people who are experiencing flu-like symptoms each week . As a result , if we tally each day 's flu-related search queries , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this discovery , we have launched Google Flu Trends , where you can find up-to-date influenza-related activity estimates for each of the 50 states in the U.S. <p> The CDC does a great job of surveying real doctors and patients to accurately track the flu , so why bother with estimates from aggregated search queries ? It turns out that traditional flu surveillance systems take 1-2 weeks to collect and release surveillance data , but Google search queries can be automatically counted very quickly . By making our flu estimates available each day , Google Flu Trends may provide an early-warning system for outbreaks of influenza . <p> For epidemiologists , this is an exciting development , because early detection of a disease outbreak can reduce the number of people affected . If a new strain of influenza virus emerges under certain conditions , a pandemic could emerge and cause millions of deaths ( as happened , for example , in 1918 ) . Our up-to-date influenza estimates may enable public health officials and health professionals to better respond to seasonal epidemics and though we hope never to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch of the Influenza Division at CDC throughout the 2007-2008 flu season , and together we saw that our search-based flu estimates had a consistently strong correlation with real CDC surveillance data . Our system is still very experimental , so anything is possible , but we 're hoping to see similar correlations in the coming year . <p> We could n't have created such good models without aggregating hundreds of billions of individual searches going back to 2003 . Of course , we 're keenly aware of the trust that users place in us and of our responsibility to protect their privacy . Flu Trends can never be used to identify individual users because we rely on anonymized , aggregated counts of how often certain search queries occur each week . The patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations of Google search users . <p> Flu season is here , so avoid becoming part of our statistics and get a flu shot ! And keep an eye on those graphs if you 're curious to see how the flu season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published an academic paper in Nature , the international journal of science , explaining the science and methodology behind Flu Trends . Check it out for more information . <h> 11/04/2008 11:07:00 AM <p> On September 12 2008 , Cecilia van Deventer , a safari booking agent living in Zambia , was flown to South Africa in critical condition . She died just two days later . By October 6 2008 , three more people had died : the paramedic who accompanied Cecilia to South Africa , the nurse who cared for her in Intensive Care , and the cleaner who cleaned her hospital room after her death . A fifth patient , a nurse who cared for the infected paramedic , is receiving anti-viral treatment . In all cases , people infected were exposed to infected blood and/or body fluids . <p> South Africa 's National Institute for Communicable Diseases ( NICD ) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( US-CDC ) quickly identified the infectious agent as an arenavirus similar to the one that causes Lassa Fever - a disease that affects 500 000 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequencing of the viral genome by Professor Ian Lipkin and colleagues at the Center for Infection and Immunity ( CII ) at Columbia University , it has been clearly shown that this is an arenavirus that has never been seen before . Google.org 's Predict and Prevent initiative recently announced a grant of $2.5 million to support CII 's work in pathogen discovery . This identification of a novel arenavirus not only represents an early success , but also demonstrates just why this work is so important . ' There is no doubt we are dealing with a newly emerged virus , ' said Dr. Janusz Paweska , head of the special pathology unit at the NICD in Johannesburg . As Professor Robert Swanepoel , also of the NICD , has pointed out , the virus is ' newly-discovered ' rather than new , and has probably been around in animal populations for some time before making a recent jump to humans . <p> Arenaviruses , normally transferred to humans through contact with the urine of their rodent hosts , can be classified into New and Old World viruses depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively . New World arenaviruses , including Junin , Machupo , Sabia and Guanarito , can cause viral hemorrhagic fever . This particular virus , classified as Old World due to its African origins , began as a flu-like illness , then caused diarrhea , pharyngitis and a rash before rapidly culminating in respiratory distress , neurological symptoms and circulatory collapse over a period of about 9-12 days . The virus has yet to receive a name . <p> Due to the swift action of the NICD , US-CDC and CII the outbreak is now described as contained . We commend their efforts !

The software receives information from utility smart meters and in-home energy management devices and visualizes this information on a personalized iGoogle homepage . Today we 're announcing both our very first UK utility partnership and our very first UK device partner . <p> Our utility partner , first:utility , is the only energy supplier in the United Kingdom to provide free smart meters to its customers , and is currently in the process of rolling them out across the country . To date , first:utility has over 30,000 customers signed up to its service .

Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company will receive $130 million to provide 771,000 meters to 100% of its customers . These technologies will enable consumers to receive direct feedback on their energy use , which can lead to energy savings of up to 15% on average . Altogether the awards will fund the installation of 18 million smart meters , 1 million in-home energy displays and 170,000 smart thermostats . <p> With the advent of smart meters and other information technologies , we have the opportunity to rebuild the electricity grid , which still uses century-old technology in places . Most importantly , we can make the grid work better for consumers .

This exploration often brings us into dialogue with many start-up social enterprises and other philanthropies trying to overcome challenges working directly with less advantaged populations . One such group , LGT Venture Philanthropy , has articulated a recurring theme : organizations with effective and innovative solutions to social and environmental problems often lack the manpower and expertise to implement these solutions in the most effective way , especially during the growth phase . They have come up with a creative solution : the iCats Program . <p> The iCats Program was designed to bridge the gap between philanthropic organizations or social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business professionals with the desire to apply their knowledge and experience to benefit the social sector , thus acting as " impact catalysts .

To help you out , we at Google.org are excited to announce the expansion of Google Flu Trends to 16 additional countries , including much of Europe . We 've also made the site available in 37 languages . Flu is a global threat , affecting millions worldwide each year , so we 're pleased to make this tool available in more regions and languages . <p> Last November , we launched Google Flu Trends in the United States after finding a close relationship between how many people search for flu-related topics and how many people actually have flu symptoms . By tracking the popularity of certain Google search queries , we are able to estimate the level of flu , in near real-time . While some traditional flu surveillance systems may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google search queries can be counted immediately . Google Flu Trends provides an additional surveillance tool that may help public health officials and the public make more informed decisions about preparing for the flu season . <p> In the past year , we 've expanded our coverage to include Mexico , New Zealand and Australia and have continued to see a good correspondence between our estimates and official flu activity data . In fact , our analysis of last season shows that Google Flu Trends had a close 0.92 correlation with official U.S. flu data . <p> An important aspect of Google Flu Trends is that we filter out terms that may be popular because people hear about them in the news . What we do not use in the models is a term like swine flu since people are more likely to type that into Google because they want to know more information about it , given the news headlines , and not because they actually have H1N1 or swine flu .

This means that utilities can enable self-serve sign-up for customers to use the Google PowerMeter gadget . More users means improved feedback on our product and this will translate into an improved product experience . Here 's how it works : If your utility has open enrollment enabled for your account , with just two simple steps you can have your usage data transmitted to Google and visible online via Google PowerMeter . <p> Yello Strom , a German utility and our first partner in Europe , is fully up and running with open enrollment .

As Executive Director Martin Vesper put it , " We are now offering our customers even more ways to maintain an overview of their electricity consumption with the help of the internet . And when people know exactly what is going on with their energy usage , they can use energy efficiently without sacrificing convenience . " <p> Other Google PowerMeter partners are also working towards open enrollment capabilities . Florida 's JEA has built an open enrollment system and is actively rolling it out within their customer base .

( That means having a smart meter installed by your utility is no longer a prerequisite for using Google PowerMeter ! ) For the last several months , a few hundred Google employees have been testing a number of in-home electricity monitoring devices . Those of us lucky enough to have one of these devices installed in our homes experienced first-hand how access to high-resolution energy use information drives meaningful behavior change . So we set out to make that data easier for everyone to access and understand by sending the collected data to our Google PowerMeter software . <p> Combined with Google PowerMeter , the TED 5000 device can help you understand your electricity usage to save energy and money .

@@13269042 @1869042/ <p> Each year we review our Google Flu Trends models and may update them , if an update would make them more accurate when compared with the official influenza data we benchmark against .

Though generally getting the trend correct , the original model underestimated the magnitude of ILI activity during the H1N1 . Why was this the case ? In short , search behavior changed during H1N1 . This was especially true for the categories " influenza complications " and " term for influenza . " This is not unexpected , since differing complications and the fact that H1N1 began spreading during the northern hemisphere summer rather than winter likely played a role . It is interesting to see how the categories and examples of specific queries changed , though .

If you can make it , RSVP here . <h> Friday 4/02/2010 12:22:00 PM <p> The international community likes to define Liberias recent history primarily through two events : its fourteen-year civil war , which ended in 2003 , and the work of the countrys president , Ellen Johnson Sirleaf , the first democratically elected female leader in Africa . The chart below illustrates both . On my recent trip to Liberia , first with a group of Bay Area philanthropists hosted by the government and then as part of a small group of Googlers on a country visit , I learned more about how terrible the 1980s and 90s were in this small West African nation . GDP -- a crude measure of the health of a nation , but an indicator nonetheless -- dropped 90% as the country endured brutal dictatorship after brutal dictatorship . That decline is the largest in any nation since World War II , and nearly twice the percentage drop that Rwanda , Zimbabwe , and other states experienced during their crises . The good news is that although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , GDP has almost risen to pre-conflict levels during Johnson Sirleafs tenure , and foreign direct investment has returned . <p> The numbers also tell a third story . Throughout the 1960s and 70s Liberias economy grew at a steady pace in a way that most other African economies did not . The growth was inequitable -- but real -- and the ingenuity and entrepreneurship that drove it are on full display today , albeit in ways that can sometimes puzzle a visitor to the country . <p> During the ten days I was in Liberia my colleagues and I always had a driver ; its the only way for foreigners to get around . The first day we reserved our car for 9:00am but when I looked out the hotel window at 9:02am I noticed the car speeding off with three other passengers . When I frantically called the driver he responded , " My man , do n't  worry -- I will get you to your meeting on time . " And he did . Then there was the night a local friend suggested dinner by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor patio at the base of Sniper Hill . . . wait , that did n't  quite sound as inviting as I meant it . " When we arrived our waiter was Frankie , a cheerful eight-year old sporting an Alex Rodriguez Yankees jersey who delivered our food and drink on the jog . At the local family restaurant , everyone pitched in . <p> Like most of Africa , cell phones are ubiquitous in Liberia and are the technology of choice for the vast majority of the population . Our meetings with the mobile providers there could have taken place anywhere in the world . They 're making money but are fiercely competitive with one another , slashing prices and offering new products to gain market share , and desperately trying to expand into new markets like broadband . Their activities are far from philanthropic , but they 're arguably having a more positive affect on Liberians day-to-day life than any other segment of society . The mobile penetration rate is 40% and rising , particularly in rural areas where phones are often the first " big " purchase a Liberian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course noticeable here as well . Liberians will often carry SIM cards from different mobile carriers and switch back and forth depending on coverage and prices ( a noticeably nice option that 's not available in the locked-down U.S. market ) . Since unanswered calls do n't  incur a charge and the person who initiates the call pays more than the receiver , Liberians will also occasionally call and hang up , meaning , " I want talk to you but you can afford this more than I can , so call me back . " Scratch cards , which give you twenty or thirty minutes of talk time , are practically used as cash and are sold virtually everywhere . <p> The past thirty years have been difficult ones for most Liberians , and with an 80% unemployment rate and known war criminals still occupying high government offices , there are still huge problems to address . In the next two years the country will hold elections and most of the UN peacekeepers will withdraw . Watch closely : if both go well , a stable Liberia may finally be back .
@@13269044 @1869044/ <h> Friday 1/28/2011 07:26:00 PM <p> Google.org continues to ramp up technology projects and test new ideas while Googles overall charitable giving , in-kind giving and employee volunteering have grown as well . Our newsletter outlines the latest updates to our philanthropic projects . I caught up with Megan Smith , VP New Business Development and General Manager of Google.org , to talk about how Google views philanthropy . <p> After two years at the helm of Google.org , what are you most optimistic about ? The Internet offers an opportunity to connect in ways never before possible . Things that have historically been far apart are now " virtually adjacent " most people are a text away , data sets can be mashed up , and all world knowledge is coming online from both expected and surprising sources . Given all of this , I am most excited about all the extraordinary ways people are using the web to connect , be informed , use data and to start solving problems together . <p> For Google.org specifically , we want to contribute our knowledge and skills to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more than 50 engineers and about 40 other cross-functional Googlers working on four or five larger projectslike Google Crisis Response and RE&lt;Cand over a dozen smaller experimental pilot projects . <p> What kind of project fits this opportunity ? One of our newer projects , Google Earth Engine , takes advantage of Googles computing infrastructure to create a planetary sciences computation platform that could help reduce negative environmental impact at scale . The first focus is on deforestation monitoring . Earth Engine has just made it through the pilot phase to a full project with its launch last month at climate change talks in Mexico . If we meet our goals to enable global-scale monitoring of changes in the planets environment , I believe that Earth Engine could play an important information role in helping to slow deforestation . <p> What 's the biggest lesson you 've learned since joining Google.org ? Two things : first , the opportunity we have is great ; and second , the work has served as a reminder that creating truly useful , innovative technology is challenging and requires patient iteration , dialog , teamwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learn from the right partners , collaborate , pilot those ideas that pass initial assessment and then launch for scale the few projects that meet the criteria for a Google.org product . <p> Do Google.org projects have a specific focus ? We do n't  have a topical focuswe work on technology solutions to many different kinds of global challenges . The key is to take advantage of Googles strengths . In the area of global health , for example , we have been able to create a global flu monitoring system based on search data . For our environmental work , we were able to leverage our data center computing power to put together the finest-scale forest map of Mexico to date ( processing this data would take two years on one computer , but we made it in less than 24 hours using our computing infrastructure ) . <p> How does Google.org start and ramp up its technology projects ? We work to tap into the talent at Google . Some projects have come out of hallway conversations and others from extensive talks with partners in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with senior engineers where talented individuals or teams within Google bring ideas or prototypes . If we think the idea is a match and has promise , we give it budget , headcount , guidance and time to see where it can go during a pilot period . Once we have a live pilot or project , we take advantage of Google.coms standard project review and management processes that our company has effectively used for years . <p> What if those pilots fail ? That 's normal . We should expect that some of them will fail or will only have smaller impact . If you 're not failing some of the time , you 're not taking risks . As we progress , some of our failures will hopefully teach us as much as some of our successes . <p> What other charitable giving does Google do ? As a company that has been doing well , its important that we push ourselves to be amongst the most generous companies . We have several charitable giving programs supporting , for example , education ( especially K-12 science and math programs ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions for underserved groups . Last year the company gave more than $145 million to non-profits and academic institutions , and more than $184 million when including Google Grants , Google.org technology projects and in-kind product support for non-profits . <p> How is this philanthropic work different from that of other companies ? Like other companies , we have charitable giving programs , we provide products in-kind and we have a range of employee volunteering programs . Some companies like ours may also have experiments like Google.org to leverage their strengthsa form of skills-based giving . However , many companies do amazing charitable work through a centralized Corporate Social Responsibility arm that tackles a key issue or two . We approach philanthropy the way we do our core business , with big goals and a " launch early and iterate " approach . Ideas come from all over the company and we work to tackle a range of issues we care about , from clean energy to education to development . It may not be as clean as the process that some others have , but we think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain determined , as our founders said when they set the vision for Google.org , " to find original ways to extend our assets , so that we can drive scalable , sustainable efforts . ... the underlying principle : Never stop looking for ways to do the best with what you have . " <p> Currently , for every well that sends cold water down to the hot rock ( called injectors ) , there are one to three wells that bring heated water back up to generate electricity ( called producers ) . But what if one well could act as both an injector and producer ? It could dramatically lower the cost of EGS ( example below ) . The Stanford team , which included graduate students Zhe Wang and Mark McClure , modeled a variety of single-well configurations to determine their feasibility . The investigation determined that on a per well basis , an optimal single-well EGS system would produce four times more energy than an isolated pair of wells and two times more energy than an infinite series of alternating producers and injectors . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , present another innovative technique for advancing baseload EGS on the path to RE&lt;C . <p> On a trip to Jerusalem three years ago , Jonathan Rosenbergvisited Yad Vashem . Struck by the museum 's vast historical record housed within the physical building , he hoped Google could do something powerful to showcase this information . Inspired by the challenge , a few of us , in our " 20% time , " started working with Yad Vashem and eventually grew our effort into a full project , introducing a YouTube channel in 2008 and now this collections site . <p> Within the archive you will find more than 130,000 images in full resolution . You can search for them via a custom search engine on Yad Vashems collections site . And by using experimental optical character recognition ( OCR ) , we 've transcribed the text on many images , making them even more discoverable on the web . This means that if you search for the name of a family member who was in the Holocaust , you might find a link to an image on the Yad Vashem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try searching for the term rena weiser , the name of a Jewish refugee . You 'll find a link to a visa issued to her by the Consulate of Chile in France . OCR technology made this picture discoverable to those searching for her . <p> Yad Vashem encourages you to add personal stories about images that have meaning for you in the " share your thoughts " section below each item . Doron Avni , a fellow Googler , has already added a story . He found a photograph of his grandfather taken immediately after his release from a Nazi prison . His grandfather had vowed that if he should survive , he would immediately have his picture taken to preserve the memory of his experience in the Holocaust . He stitched the photo into his coat , an act that later saved his life . After hiding in the forest for a year , Russian soldiers mistook him for a German enemy , but released him once they saw this picture . <p> Dorons grandfather <p> The Yad Vashem partnership is part of our larger effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in similar projects in the past including digitizing major libraries in Europe , collections at the Prado Museum in Madrid , and the LIFE photo archive .

The symptoms are similar to a severe flu , and can be quite painful . There is no cure and no vaccine . Fortunately , dengue rarely causes death , though severe complications , like dengue hemorrhagic fever , can be lethal . <p> The bottom line ? Be smart about protecting yourself from dengue . Know the areas where dengue is present ( DengueMap is helpful for this ) and wear bug spray .

As shown in the figure below , Liberia has one of the lowest volumes of Internet traffic per capita in the world , and ranks in the bottom quintile within Africa . <p> Historically constrained by slow and expensive satellite connections for Internet connectivity , the country expects to connect to the ACE submarine cable in 2013 . This international connectivity will enable the deployment of low-cost infrastructure and accelerate the adoption of inexpensive Internet-enabled devices . As such , Liberia has an excellent opportunity to harness the Internet for economic and human development gains over the next few years . <p> At Google.org , we are contributing ideas for Liberias efforts to build Internet capacity , outlined in a white paper , " Best Practices for Liberias Internet Ecosystem . " We outline principles for establishing a strong Internet foundation in Liberia .

Last week we introduced Google Correlate , an experimental tool enabling researchers to model real-world behavior using search trends . Weve heard from many researchers who want to mine this data for new discoveries about economics and public healthmuch like we designed Google Flu Trends to give an early warning about flu outbreaks . We hope they 're able to make useful discoveries with Google Correlate . <p> While building Google Correlate , we used it to create an early warning system for another important disease . Google Dengue Trends in Bolivia , Brazil , India , Indonesia and Singapore provides an additional surveillance tool for a disease that affects about 100 million people each year . Dengue is a virus spread through mosquito bites that creates symptoms including high fever , severe headache and pain , rash and mild bleeding . There is no vaccine or treatment , so public health efforts are largely focused on helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Singapore has an impressively timely surveillance system for dengue , but in many countries it can take weeks or months for dengue case data to be collected , analyzed and made available . During the dengue outbreak at last years Commonwealth Games , we discussed the need for timely dengue information . With help from Professor John Brownstein and Emily Chan from HealthMap , a program at Childrens Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School , we were able to create our system . Using the dengue case count data provided by Ministries of Health and the World Health Organization , were able to build a model that offers near real-time estimates of dengue activity based on the popularity of certain search terms . Google Dengue Trends is automatically updated every day , thereby providing an early indicator of dengue activity . <p> We hope the early warning provided by Google Dengue Trends helps health officials and the public prepare for potential dengue outbreaks . For those who live in places where dengue is present , remember to follow the advice of health officials to prevent infection by wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by gathering standing water . <h> Wednesday 5/25/2011 08:34:00 AM <p> It all started with the flu . In 2008 , we found that the activity of certain search terms are good indicators of actual flu activity . Based on this finding , we launched Google Flu Trends to provide timely estimates of flu activity in 28 countries . Since then , we 've seen a number of other researchersincluding our very ownuse search activity data to estimate other real world activities . <p> However , tools that provide access to search data , such as Google Trends or Google Insights for Search , werent designed with this type of research in mind . Those systems allow you to enter a search term and see the trend ; but researchers told us they want to enter the trend of some real world activity and see which search terms best match that trend . In other words , they wanted a system that was like Google Trends but in reverse . <p> This is now possible with Google Correlate , which were launching today on Google Labs . Using Correlate , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of search terms whose popularity best corresponds with that real world trend . In the example below , we uploaded official flu activity data from the U.S. CDC over the last several years and found that people search for terms like cold or flu in a similar pattern to actual flu rates . Finding out these correlated terms is how we built Google Flu Trends : <p> You can also enter a search term such as ribosome and find other terms whose activity corresponds well over time with the one you 're interested in : <p> It turns out cell biology is n't all too popular in the summer time ( sorry biologists ! ) . What 's interesting is that the ups and downs of web search activity for cell biology terms is unique enough that searching on Correlate for ribosome brings up searches for other biology terms , such as mitochondria . Of course , correlation is n't the same thing as causation , so we cant explain why two terms follow the same pattern . But my guess in this case is that both terms are popular when schools teach these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data that may lead to advances in economics , health and other fields ; but we need to handle that data with privacy controls in mind . With this system , we do n't  care what any one person is searching for . In fact , we rely on millions of anonymized search queries issued to Google over time , and the patterns we observe in the data are only meaningful across large populations . <h> Tuesday 5/24/2011 05:43:00 PM <p> Two years ago representatives from Google , Microsoft , Yahoo ! , Hewlett-Packard , NASA and the World Bank came together to form the Random Hacks of Kindness ( RHoK ) program . The idea was simple : technology can and should be used for good . RHoK brings together subject matter experts , volunteer software developers and designers to create open source and technology agnostic software solutions that address challenges facing humanity .

For example , Google Person Finder which helps loved ones reconnect during emergencies managed more than 600,000 records following the earthquake in Japan , and there were more than 36 million page views within the first 48 hours alone . <p> During her testimony , Shona outlined three reasons how simple , standard and open Internet-based technologies are critical tools for emergency responders and affected populations : the Internet often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Internet services during emergencies , and the Internet scales and promotes openness . <h> 5/05/2011 02:40:00 PM <p> Last Thursday , the Google Map Maker team , along with the World Bank and UNITAR/UNOSAT , held a unique event at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington , D.C. , and a satellite event in Nairobi at the same time . More than 70 members of the Sudanese diaspora , along with regional experts from the World Bank , Sudan Institute , Voices for Sudan , The Enough Project and other organizations gathered together to map what is expected to become the worlds newest country later this year : the Republic of South Sudan . UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has asked the international community " to assist all Sudanese towards greater stability and development " during and beyond this period of transition . <p> South Sudan is a large but under-mapped region , and there are very few high-quality maps that display essential features like roads , hospitals and schools .

To aid their work , we 've published updated satellite imagery of the region , covering 125,000 square kilometers and 40 percent of the U.N.s priority areas , to Google Earth and Maps . <p> The goal of last weeks event was to engage and train members of the Sudanese diaspora in the United States , and others who have lived and worked in the region , to use Google Map Maker so they could contribute their local knowledge of the region to the ongoing mapping effort , particularly in the area of social infrastructure . Our hope is that this event and others like it will help build a self-sufficient mapping community that will contribute their local expertise and remain engaged in Sudan over time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us : " I used to live in this small village that before today did not exist on any maps that I know of ... a place unknown to the world .

" <p> The group worked together to make several hundred edits to the map of Sudan in four hours . As those edits are approved , theyll appear live in Google Maps , available for all the world to see . But this wasnt just a one-day undertakingattendees will now return to their home communities armed with new tools and ready to teach their friends and family how to join the effort .

Numerous nonprofits have already used Google Earth to raise awareness about an issue or cause that demonstrate innovation and creativity . The US Holocaust Memorial Museum and partners created the Crisis in Darfur Google Earth layer , which utilized Google Earths high-resolution satellite imagery to document the burning of villages , destruction of communities and livelihoods as a result of the genocide in Sudan .

This is what the official data - available at national scale only - reflect . The assumption is that every water point and every toilet will provide adequate and sustainable services to a fixed number of people .

@@13269059 @1869059/ <h> Thursday 12/17/2009 06:38:00 PM <p> ( Cross-posted from the Official Google Blog to bring you information on other green efforts at Google ) <p> As leaders from around the world meet in Copenhagen to address global climate change this month , we thought it was a good time to reflect on our own carbon footprint . In 2007 , we committed to become a carbon neutral company . We know that it is n't possible to write a check and eliminate the environmental impact of our operations . So what does " carbon neutrality " mean to us ? <p> First , we aggressively pursue reductions in our energy consumption through energy efficiency , innovative infrastructure design and operations and on-site renewable energy . Our Google designed data centers use half the energy of typical facilities . We 're also working to accelerate the development of economic , clean renewable energy at scale through research and development , investment and policy outreach . At this time , however , such efforts do n't cover our entire carbon footprint . Therefore , since 2007 we 've gone a step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover the portion of our footprint that we can not yet eliminate which is what we mean by " carbon neutrality . " <p> So what exactly is a carbon offset ? The idea behind an offset is that we pay someone to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a specific , measurable way , thus offseting an equal climate impact on our side . To determine our impact , we calculate our annual carbon footprint , which is then verified by an independent third party . We include direct energy consumption ( like natural gas ) and electricity use , employee commuting , company vehicle use , business travel and estimates of carbon emissions from building construction and from the manufacturing of servers used in our datacenters . We then buy an equivalent number of carbon offsets . <p> While carbon offsets seem simple in principle , in practice they are surprisingly complicated . In particular , it 's often difficult to say whether or not the offset project results in emissions reductions that would have happened anyway . We find ourselves asking whether the project in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of offsets , this concept is referred to as " additionality . " Carbon offsets have a mixed reputation because some projects are not additional . Here at Google , we have set a very high bar to ensure that our investment makes an actual difference in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing offsets that are real , verifiable , permanent and additional . <p> To date , we have selected high quality carbon offsets from around the world that reduce greenhouse gas emissions ranging from landfill gas projects in Caldwell County , NC , and Steuben County , NY , to animal-waste management systems in Mexico and Brazil . Our funding helps make it possible for equipment to be installed that captures and destroys the methane gas produced as the waste decomposes . Methane , the primary component in natural gas , is a significant contributor to global warming . We chose to focus on landfill and agricultural methane reduction projects because methane 's impact on warming is very well understood , it 's easy to measure how much methane is captured and the capture would n't happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , they could n't make enough money selling the gas ) . <p> We need fundamental changes to global energy and transportation infrastructure to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions over the long term . In the meantime , the projects to which we contribute offer measurable emissions reductions and allow us to take responsibility for our carbon footprint . To that end , we 're always looking for good emissions-reduction projects to support . If you have a landfill gas or agricultural methane carbon offset project you think we should consider , please visit this page for more information about how to participate in our latest carbon-offset procurement round . <h> Wednesday 12/16/2009 02:37:00 PM <p> I 'm here in Copenhagen this week , at the COP15 International Climate Change Conference . Whether you 're attending in-person , or reading news headlines from home , you ca n't miss the fact that addressing climate change requires the world to solve a mind-boggling mix of science , policy and political issues . These are formidable challenges , but new technologies can help provide solutions for these complex problems . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an accord to compensate countries for preserving forests and other natural landscapes that play a crucial role in reducing emissions . Implementation of the agreement , known as Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation , or REDD , will require the ability to accurately track deforestation at a regional and global level . <p> Despite the widespread availability of global satellite imagery through products like Google Earth and Google Maps , it has n't been easy for tropical nations to understand the state of their ecosystem , and to quantitatively monitor changes in forest coverage or other key indicators . That 's why I 'm proud to announce a new computational platform for global-scale analysis of satellite imagery : Earth Engine , powered by Google . <p> At an event today hosted by Avoided Deforestation Partners , global leaders from the President of Guyana to the Prime Minister of Norway expressed their support for REDD . Earlier today , the U.S , Australia , France , Japan , Norway and Britain pledged $3.5 billion over the next three years to protect rainforests . At the event , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth Engine that we developed together with the Carnegie Institution for Science , IMAZON and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation . Traditional forest monitoring is complex and expensive , requiring access to large amounts of satellite data , lots of hard drives to hold the data , lots of computers to process the data , and lots of time while you wait for various computations to finish . Our prototype demonstrates how Earth Engine makes all of this easier , by moving everything into the cloud . Google supplies data , storage , and computing muscle . As a result , you can visualize forest change in fractions of a second over the web , instead of the minutes or hours that traditional offline systems require for such analysis . The prototype applications running on Earth Engine are n't yet available to the public , but you can see screen shots in our earlier blog post . <p> We want to ensure this technology is widely available when it 's ready , so today I formally announced Google.org 's commitment to provide our Earth Engine free to tropical countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is just the first of many Earth Engine applications that will help enable scientists , policymakers , and the general public to better monitor and understand the Earth 's ecosystems . <h> Tuesday 12/15/2009 09:39:00 AM <p> People often get up in settings like the international climate change conference in Copenhagen and make complicated pronouncements that leave heads spinning . Today was different . Google , GE , the Climate Group , and NRDC , supported by other leading businesses and NGOs , had a simple message : governments across the world should ensure people have real-time access to their home energy information . <p> Most of us know little about how we use energy in our homes , other than what our monthy power bill tells us . Yet studies show that when people can see in real-time how much energy they are using , they save up to 15% on their electricity use with simple behavioral changes , and even more with investments in energy efficiency . The savings are huge when added up : if all US households reduced 15% of their energy use by 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and would save consumers $46 billion on their energy bills . <p> As 40,000 people gather in Copenhagen to fight global warming , we think that 's a solution that governments should be paying attention to . This group , which will take other actions after the meeting has ended , has begun a push to give ordinary citizens the tools to save money and save the planet . A lot of the decisions on the table in Copenhagen are hard , we believe this one is simple . <h> Thursday 12/10/2009 04:59:00 AM <p> Today , at the International Climate Change Conference ( COP15 ) in Copenhagen , we demonstrated a new technology prototype that enables online , global-scale observation and measurement of changes in the earth 's forests . We hope this technology will help stop the destruction of the world 's rapidly-disappearing forests . Emissions from tropical deforestation are comparable to the emissions of all of the European Union , and are greater than those of all cars , trucks , planes , ships and trains worldwide . According to the Stern Review , protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut carbon emissions and mitigate climate change . The United Nations has proposed a framework known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) that would provide financial incentives to rainforest nations to protect their forests , in an effort to make forests worth " more alive than dead . " Implementing a global REDD system will require that each nation have the ability to accurately monitor and report the state of their forests over time , in a manner that is independently verifiable . However , many of these tropical nations of the world lack the technological resources to do this , so we 're working with scientists , governments and non-profits to change this . Here 's what we 've done with this prototype to help nations monitor their forests : <p> Start with satellite imagerySatellite imagery data can provide the foundation for measurement and monitoring of the world 's forests . For example , in Google Earth today , you can fly to Rondonia , Brazil and easily observe the advancement of deforestation over time , from 1975 to 2001 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of imagery data past , present and future is available all over the globe . Even so , while today you can view deforestation in Google Earth , until now there has n't been a way to measure it . <p> Then add scienceWith this technology , it 's now possible for scientists to analyze raw satellite imagery data and extract meaningful information about the world 's forests , such as locations and measurements of deforestation or even regeneration of a forest . In developing this prototype , we 've collaborated with Greg Asner of Carnegie Institution for Science , and Carlos Souza of Imazon . Greg and Carlos are both at the cutting edge of forest science and have developed software that creates forest cover and deforestation maps from satellite imagery . Organizations across Latin America use Greg 's program , Carnegie Landsat Analysis System ( CLASlite ) , and Carlos ' program , Sistema de Alerta de Deforestation ( SAD ) , to analyze forest cover change . However , widespread use of this analysis has been hampered by lack of access to satellite imagery data and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudWhat if we could offer scientists and tropical nations access to a high-performance satellite imagery-processing engine running online , in the " Google cloud " ? And what if we could gather together all of the earths raw satellite imagery data petabytes of historical , present and future data and make it easily available on this platform ? We decided to find out , by working with Greg and Carlos to re-implement their software online , on top of a prototype platform we 've built that gives them easy access to terabytes of satellite imagery and thousands of computers in our data centers . <p> Here are the results of running CLASlite on the satellite imagery sequence shown above : <p> CLASlite online - This shows deforestation and degradation in Rondonia , Brazil from 1986-2008 , with the red indicating recent activity <p> Here 's the result of running SAD in a region of recent deforestation pressure in Mato Grosso , Brazil : <p> SAD online - The red " hotspots " indicate deforestation that has happened within the last 30 days <p> Combining science with massive data and technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unprecedented speed : On a top-of-the-line desktop computer , it can take days or weeks to analyze deforestation over the Amazon . Using our cloud-based computing power , we can reduce that time to seconds . Being able to detect illegal logging activities faster can help support local law enforcement and prevent further deforestation from happening . <p> Ease of use and lower costs : An online platform that offers easy access to data , scientific algorithms and computation horsepower from any web browser can dramatically lower the cost and complexity for tropical nations to monitor their forests . <p> Security , privacy and transparency : Governments and researchers do n't want to share sensitive data and results before they are ready . Our cloud-based platform allows users to control access to their data and results . At the same time , because the data , analysis and results reside online , they can also be easily shared , made available for collaboration , presented to the public and independently verified when appropriate . <p> Climate change impact : We think that a suitably scaled-up and enhanced version of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring , reporting and verification ( MRV ) in support of efforts such as REDD . <p> As a Google.org product , this technology will be provided to the world as a not-for-profit service . This technology prototype is currently available to a small set of partners for testing purposes it 's not yet available to the general public but we expect to make it more broadly available over the next year . We are grateful to a host of individuals and organizations ( find full list here ) who have advised us on developing this technology . In particular , we would like to thank the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for their close partnership since the initial inception of this project . The goal of the Moore Foundations Environmental Conservation Program is to change the ways in which people use important terrestrial and coastal marine ecosystems to conserve critical ecological systems and functions , while allowing sustainable use . We 're also working with the Group on Earth Observations ( GEO ) , a consortium of national government bodies , inter-governmental organizations , space agencies and research institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . Last month together we launched the GEO FCT portal and are now exploring how we can also together bring the power of this new technology to tropical nations . <p> We 're excited to be able to share this early prototype and look forward to seeing what 's possible . <h> Tuesday 12/08/2009 11:22:00 AM <p> Last Monday , we hosted experts from the U.S. Department of Energy , MIT , Stanford , UC Berkeley , Nth Power and Google for a discussion on clean energy innovation in our San Francisco office . The panelists focused on the important role innovation plays in seizing the economic benefits of developing and deploying cost-effective low carbon technologies . <p> These policies , if adopted and supported , will help us at last put in place what has been lacking in terms of clean energy innovation : a robust pipeline extending from basic research to applied research to demonstration projects to commercial scale-up to full deployment . At Google , we call this cycle " Lightbulbs to Lightbulbs " -- from the initial " lightbulb moment " of invention to full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the whole process .

Youll be more comfortable using these tools in the event of a disaster if you 've already tried them outand even integrated them into your daily life . <h> 8/31/2011 03:55:00 AM <p> People often share stories with us about the ways the Internet has helped them during natural disasters . Whether its accessing information about the event , communicating with loved ones during a crisis or finding out how to help respond in the aftermath , the web plays a valuable role . <p> We looked up some statistics from our search data for several natural disasters to get insights into this phenomenon . We see two consistent trends in search behavior and internet use in the affected areas : a substantial ( and often dominant ) proportion of searches are directly related to the crises ; and people continue to search and access information online even while traffic and search levels drop temporarily during and immediately following the crises . While in some cases internet access is restricted due to infrastructure failures , generally Internet Service Providers continue to provide connectivity and users take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet can be in times of crises , compared to other infrastructure . <p> We expect these trends will continue , and to a great extent this drives the ongoing work of the Google Crisis Response team to improve the information available on the ' net during crises . <p> Joplin Tornado , Joplin , MO , USA , May 2011The week of this years tornadoes in Joplin , Missouri , searches for terms related to help , safety and recovery were significantly up from normal levels . Disaster relief was 2054 percent greater than normal and FEMA , American Red Cross , and National Weather Service showed increases of 400-1000% . Despite the tragedy , in which 25 percent of the town was destroyed and 75 percent damaged , we still saw search traffic at 58 percent of normal levels the day of the tornado , and an immediate recovery toward normal Internet traffic occured within a day of the event . <p> Hurricane Katrina , New Orleans , LA , USA , August 2005During Hurricane Katrina , one of the largest U.S. disasters in recent memory , terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while search queries for resource providers like FEMA and the American Red Cross grew the fastest , according to our data . Even as 90% of the population was evacuated from New Orleans , we still saw search traffic at more than 50 percent of normal in Louisiana and 20% of normal in New Orleans , based on the previous five-day average . <p> The Internet has proven to be an essential resource during natural disasters internationally as well . <p> Japan Earthquake and Tsunami , Northern Coast , Japan , March , 2011During the Japan earthquake and tsunami , searches for earthquake information and impacts including terms like outage , tokyo electric power and rolling blackouts gew the fasted and also topped the list of most searched queries across Japan . In fact , even in the hardest hit areas , where mobile and landline communications were disrupted , Internet services were largely unaffected . During this time , people entered 620,000 records into Google Person Finder , a tool developed by the Google Crisis Response team to help people find missing friends and loved ones in the aftermath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , February 2010 Immediately following the earthquake , people searching online were actively looking for earthquake information ; earthquake and news source search terms became eight of the top 10 queries . Terremoto was the most searched term , and two online news sources , Terra and Emol , and the National Office for Emergencies onemi also appeared as top keywords . While there was no search traffic for 15 minutes after the earthquake , within one day searches had recovered to 25 percent of normal traffic , and search traffic returned to pre-earthquake levels within just four days . <p> Haiti Earthquake , Port-Au-Prince , Haiti , January 2010 The month of the Haiti earthquake , seismeor " earthquake " was the fastest-growing search term , and it continued its surface as a frequently searched term for almost two months after the earthquake . In the capital city of Port-Au-Prince , at the center of the earthquake , search traffic stopped momentarily , but did not completely disappear even when the three submarine Internet cables were cut as a result of the earthquake . As outlined by this U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to quickly reroute connections through a microwave relay wireless communication between Haiti and the Dominican Republic . This allowed traffic to return to rise within one day , and reach normal levels within a few months , despite ongoing damage to the city and countrys infrastructure . <p> Were excited about continuing our work to create and support products that make the Internet even more useful to people looking for information and communication during crises . <h> Saturday 8/27/2011 11:01:00 AM <p> Yesterday , we posted about our new Google Crisis Map , with the latest available geographic information on current disasters including Hurricane Irene . This morning , we put together a New York specific Crisis Map for Hurricane Irene , including Evacuation Zones , Shelter , and Storm Tracking .

If the symptoms and complications of pandemic flu were similar to seasonal flu , we expected Google Flu Trends would be able to detect it . <p> Time series plots of ILINet data and original and updated Google Flu Trends estimates <p> A.

Though generally getting the trend correct , the original model underestimated the magnitude of ILI activity during the H1N1 . Why was this the case ? In short , search behavior changed during H1N1 . This was especially true for the categories " influenza complications " and " term for influenza . " This is not unexpected , since differing complications and the fact that H1N1 began spreading during the northern hemisphere summer rather than winter likely played a role . It is interesting to see how the categories and examples of specific queries changed , though . For some specific examples , read the paper . <p> Were soon headed into flu season for the half of the world in the Northern hemisphere , so let 's stay healthy ! <p> To help explore this information , we 've created the Google Crisis Map , a map viewer with the latest available geographic information .

Several years ago Google.org provided $1,450,000 in funding to the Carter Center to support the eradication of this debilitating , 3,000 year old disease from Ghana . Its now been 14 months since the last case of Guinea worm was reported there . <p> This is a fantastic accomplishment that took a lot of hard work by the Carter Center , the Ministry of Health and their partners . There is no drug to prevent the infection of Guinea worm disease . Thus , our funds supported health education , as village-based health workers were trained to educate people about the origins of the disease and how to prevent it . In addition , these health workers mobilized to treat water sources , advocate for the provision of clean water , and monitor and contain cases of Guinea worm . With our funds in 2008 , the Carter Center achieved an 85% reduction in cases--the largest year over year percentage reduction seen in the history of the program ! Ghana now enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certification of its success . <p> Guinea worm is caused by a roundworm that lays its larvae in water . When people drink the infected water the larvae hatch inside them and can grow up to 3 feet in length before painfully emerging through their skin about a year later . There 's no way of knowing where the worm will emerge . Its not unusual for it to exit near the ankle or foot , which impairs the victims movement and ability to work . Its a slow and painful process to remove the worm without breaking it off in the patient . Often , affected individuals seek relief by submerging their sores in water , at which point the worm releases new larvae into the water and the cycle continues . <p> In 1986 , when the Carter Center began the campaign to eradicate Guinea worm , there were more than 3.5 million cases across 20 countries in Asia and Africa . Today , only 3 countries remain : South Sudan , Mali and Ethiopia . So far this year only 800 cases have been reported . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eradicated .

In the days that followed , a record number of volunteers flooded disaster response agencies , government agencies , churches and local outreach organizations with calls to find out how they could help . I was one of those volunteers and what I experienced changed my life forever . <p> Three years later , much of the region remains abandoned . Repair of city infrastructure and tourism ( the primary economic source for this part of the nation ) are slow and stagnant in much of the region . We will be successful in turning around these trends only if we come together and rededicate ourselves to this effort .

Notable exceptions to this shut down were two organizations to which I have personal ties - St. Bernard Project and The Idea Village . <p> St. Bernard Project is a nonprofit , community-based organization that began rebuilding homes in August 2006 ( boasting 177 projects to date ) that were damaged by flood waters from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in St. Bernard Parish , Louisiana . St. Bernard Parish is a working class community and was one of the hardest hit parishes of the city because of its location just 5 miles from the now infamous Industrial Levee . <p> The Idea Village is an organization working to accelerate the growth of the entrepreneurial community in the embattled New Orleans region .

The Idea Village 's motto is " Trust Your Crazy Ideas , " but I do n't see anything crazy about wanting to rebuild one of America 's greatest cities . <p> The highlight of the trip was that at each build site , the families whose homes we were returning to their former grace stopped by to say hello , offer their gratitude and recount the stories of survival . Andrea was the owner of the home I was rebuilding . She was the mother of two small children and was anxious to return a sense of normalcy to all of their lives .

Even with all of the progress made to get people back into their homes , communities are fractured and without basic services and business opportunities . <p> On the final day of our trip , we went to the Upper and Lower Ninth Ward , the areas most devastated by the hurricanes . The neighborhoods were absent of life ; there is little or nothing for residents to come back to . But signs of hope included children riding bikes , families and neighbors barbecuing on the front lawns of their homes ( many still tattooed with the post storm FEMA markings ) and a few bold projects such as the The Musicians ' Village and Brad Pitt 's Make it Right project .

Back in 2008 , a team at Google dug into this behavior and found that certain search terms were good indicators of flu levels . We later launched Google Flu Trends to estimate flu activity in near real-time using aggregated Google search data , in regions around the world . <p> At the end of every flu season , we evaluate the performance of our model . Are our estimates accurate ? What worked well , or not so well ? Do we need to make any updates ? After the 2009 H1N1 season , for example , we updated the model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 , the model had performed well at the national and regional levels in the US and no update was needed . <p> Flu Trends can help estimate the start , peak , and duration of each flu season--all important information for public health agencies . During the 2012-2013 season in the US , the model performed well in estimating the start and duration of the season . However , the model overestimated the severity of the flu . In January 2013 , after spotting the difference between our estimates and the percentage of healthcare visits for influenza-like illnesses ( ILI ) reported by the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , we started to investigate the high estimates . We found that heightened media coverage on the severity of the flu season resulted in an extended period in which users were searching for terms we 've identified as correlated with flu levels . In early 2013 , we saw more flu-related searches in the US than ever before . <p> We evaluated several options to improve the model . Ultimately , we determined that an update using the peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity for recent seasons . We will be applying this update to the US flu level estimates for the 2013-2014 flu season , starting from August 1st . A casual observer will see that the new model forecasts a lower flu level than last years model did at a similar time in the season . We believe the new model more closely approximates CDC data . <p> You can check out the new models estimates against previous years flu levels in this graph : <p> For those of you who want more data and details , we presented this paper recently at the ISNTD Bites conference . This is an iterative process . We will keep exploring how we can build resilience to accommodate the effect of news media . In the meantime , stay healthy ! <h> Wednesday 10/23/2013 12:02:00 PM <p> A catastrophe or natural disaster can occur when least expected . That 's why the Google Crisis Response Team created Public Alerts and Crisis Map to help people better prepare for these unfortunate situations . Today , were launching Google Public Alerts and Crisis Map in Colombia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during , and after a natural disaster such as a tropical storm , hurricane , flood or landslide.Starting today , relevant information about extreme weather changes which threaten the safety of Colombians will appear on Google Public Alerts as well as emergency related information for impacted areas on Crisis Map . This information will also be displayed in Google Search , Google Maps , Google Maps Mobile and Google Now . Our goal at Google Crisis Response is to provide citizens with the critical information needed in an emergency . Were able to provide Public Alerts and Crisis Map in Colombia thanks to the support of the Colombian Institute of Hydrology , Meteorology and Environmental Studies ( IDEAM ) and the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management ( UNGRD ) . Colombia is the first country in Latin America to implement the system . Public Alerts is currently available in five other countries : Australia , Canada , Japan , Taiwan , and the United States . <p> Google Public Alerts and Crisis Map <p> Google Public Alerts helps you find important weather information without even looking for it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floods , and providing instructions for severe weather conditions and non-weather alerts such as missing persons , wildfires and earthquakes . This information is displayed on Google Maps , Google Search and Google Now when you activate it on your Android device . <p> Example of the Google Public Alerts global page <p> Google Public Alerts now provides accurate and relevant emergency alerts when and where you need them in Colombia . For example , if a red alert is issued for flooding in your area , you 'll see the alert when doing a relevant search on Google or Google Maps , either on desktop or mobile , and will have access to timely information : <p> Example of a Google Search result showing a red alert <p> You can see alert details through the More information link .

Disease spreads rapidly with over one billion people forced to defecate outside due to a lack of sanitation and indoor plumbing ; in fact , unsafe water and sanitation is the most important environmental cause of ill-health , with millions dying every year as a result of poor water , sanitation and hygiene conditions . Young children in particular tend to suffer from water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea . <p> Success in water supply and sanitation interventions is commonly measured in terms of the number of wells dug , public water points connected or public toilets constructed .

Vincent Casey of WaterAid summarized their report as : " Water point data mapped by WaterAid Tanzania has demonstrated that nearly half ( 46% ) of rural water points are not functional . A quarter of all new water points are no longer working just two years after installation .

@@13269108 @1869108/ <h> Thursday 7/10/2008 04:26:00 PM <p> HakiElimu , one of Google.orgs partners , recently released an important report about the quality of education in Tanzania to stimulate a national discussion about the challenges facing the education sector . Media coverage in Dar es Salaam indicates the report has already made an impression and is prompting the government to act . <p> For too long , success in the education sector has been defined by the number of schools and classrooms built and by the increase in student enrollment - measures that do n't necessarily register learning . But the conversation is now shifting : " quality " has become more front and center , forcing governments and development agencies to re-evaluate their policies . <p> Its hard to address the " quality " issue without knowing what children can and can not do . Part of HakiElimus report captures a " snapshot of the quality of education actually provided in schools by presenting the results of short tests administered to children in primary and secondary schools . " The sample pool is small , but the findings are interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Here are two of the findings that I found most powerful and alarming : <p> One of the tests was a short dictation in both Kiswahili , the national language , and English ( a total of 483 primary school students and 559 secondary school students were tested ) . While students scored higher on the Kiswahili dictations , HakiElimu found it " concerning that 25% of primary pupils Kiswahili dictations were rated " poor . " Pupils who took this test had completed six years of schooling in Kiswahili and yet one in four were unable to write a coherent paragraph as dictated in the national language . In the dictations , students in both primary and secondary schools made fundamental errors in punctuation , giving researchers the impression that these things are not taught in schools . Children were often using the improper case for letters . Similarly , many did not appear to have a sense of spacing between words , or between letters in the word and between sentences . Knowledge of punctuation was also limited " ( page 29 ) <p> The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kiswahili while in secondary schools the language of instruction is in English . As the report indicates , this is problematic . <p> " Overall , data show that while childrens Kiswahili language competencies are generally well developed , English language competencies are poorly developed in both primary and secondary school students . Students had difficulty in reading , writing and translating the language . This is particularly troublesome in case of secondary school students . On entering secondary schools , children not only have to relearn all the terms and concepts in a new language but also to take on a more difficult set of subjects . If the majority of the students in secondary schools are unable to read and understand the language in which they are taught , as our data show , it is difficult to see how their learning can be enhanced . ( page 33 ) <p> My colleagues and I often say " you ca n't fix what you cant see . " This report helps to highlight to communities , organizations and the government that while money might be spent on education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More information and data about these outcomes help create the metrics , so action can be taken to fix these gaps . We are proud of HakiElimu 's work and their commitment to ensuring that citizens and government know more about the quality of education in Tanzania . We believe that the information and the discussions it is sparking in Tanzania are important first steps toward improving the educational system .
@@13269110 @1869110/ <h> Thursday 12/13/2007 09:15:00 AM <p> Posted by Kirsten Olsen , Project Manager , Google.org <p> Though all 15,000 participants of the UN climate conference have come to Bali to discuss the global response to climate change , there are many points of entry to the debate . Some enter through the policy door , seeking better rules to mandate emissions reductions . Others enter through the investment door , seeking profit from carbon markets and clean technologies . And an increasing number of participants come through the global development door , seeking " climate justice " for poor populations effected by global warming . As Meena Raman of Friends of the Earth International in Malaysia explained , " We all agree that climate change is happening , but now we have to ask the question of how to share the burden of adjustment . " <p> Just how large that " burden of adjustment " will be is uncertain , but the UN Human Development Report released in anticipation of UN Conference proclaims that " climate change is the defining human development challenge of the 21st Century " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall and then reverse international efforts to reduce poverty . " The idea of climate justice comes into play when considering who will pay for climate adaptation when those countries that have done the least to cause global warming bear the greatest cost . Different groups here in Bali have even attempted to put a dollar amount to the cost of adaptation . Oxfam , for example , estimates the cost to be $50 billion per year and far more if emissions are not cut rapidly . <p> For many NGOs in Bali , climate change offers an opportunity to engage a new community of stakeholders and introduce ideas of environmental equity into the debate . Victoria Tauli-Corpuz , the Chairperson of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , described the phenomenon as a " moment to challenge traditional development paradigms . " Local organizations such as the Indonesian Civil Society Forum for Climate Justice have sprung up in the past year to address the climate challenge while more established NGOs such as UNICEF have begun to incorporate work on climate justice and adaptation into their work . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bali focus on climate justice and adaptation , they are still a relatively small percentage of the overall NGO representation at the conference . Michael Dorsey from Dartmouth College and the Durban Group for Climate Justice points out that the International Emissions Trading Association ( IETA ) still dominates in Bali with 336 representatives making up 8% of all NGOs listed . That is equal to more than the delegation of Greenpeace ( 2% ) , the World Wildlife Fund ( 1.6% ) and Friends of the Earth ( 1.5% ) combined . <p> One silver lining that is gaining momentum here in Bali is the idea of " green jobs " created in the new energy economy . Most admit that further research on this topic is necessary to determine which sectors of society will benefit most from these jobs , but the concept resonates with many climate justice advocates in search for solutions .

Whether you 're attending in-person , or reading news headlines from home , you ca n't miss the fact that addressing climate change requires the world to solve a mind-boggling mix of science , policy and political issues . These are formidable challenges , but new technologies can help provide solutions for these complex problems . For example , one of the most promising areas of compromise has been an accord to compensate countries for preserving forests and other natural landscapes that play a crucial role in reducing emissions . Implementation of the agreement , known as Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Forest Degradation , or REDD , will require the ability to accurately track deforestation at a regional and global level . <p> Despite the widespread availability of global satellite imagery through products like Google Earth and Google Maps , it has n't been easy for tropical nations to understand the state of their ecosystem , and to quantitatively monitor changes in forest coverage or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce a new computational platform for global-scale analysis of satellite imagery : Earth Engine , powered by Google . <p> At an event today hosted by Avoided Deforestation Partners , global leaders from the President of Guyana to the Prime Minister of Norway expressed their support for REDD . Earlier today , the U.S , Australia , France , Japan , Norway and Britain pledged $3.5 billion over the next three years to protect rainforests . At the event , I demonstrated a prototype forest monitoring application built on top of Earth Engine that we developed together with the Carnegie Institution for Science , IMAZON and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation . Traditional forest monitoring is complex and expensive , requiring access to large amounts of satellite data , lots of hard drives to hold the data , lots of computers to process the data , and lots of time while you wait for various computations to finish . Our prototype demonstrates how Earth Engine makes all of this easier , by moving everything into the cloud . Google supplies data , storage , and computing muscle . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a second over the web , instead of the minutes or hours that traditional offline systems require for such analysis . The prototype applications running on Earth Engine are n't yet available to the public , but you can see screen shots in our earlier blog post . <p> We want to ensure this technology is widely available when it 's ready , so today I formally announced Google.org 's commitment to provide our Earth Engine free to tropical countries to support their forest monitoring programs . I believe that this is just the first of many Earth Engine applications that will help enable scientists , policymakers , and the general public to better monitor and understand the Earth 's ecosystems .
@@13269112 @1869112/ <h> Wednesday 10/15/2008 01:45:00 PM <p> Today is Blog Action Day , an annual event that rallies blogs around the world to post about a common cause . This year 's issue up for discussion is poverty , so we wanted to take a look at the relationship between access to information and social and economic development . The right information at the right time in the hands of people has enormous power . As someone who works for Google , I see evidence of this everyday as people search and find information they need to create knowledge , grow their business , or access essential services . But that applies primarily to the rich world , where economies are built on knowledge and presume access to information . What about the poor and developing countries where people are offline more than online ? How do they benefit from the power of information ? <p> In much of Sub-Saharan Africa , for example , rates of economic growth over the last decade have exceeded 5% every year . Despite this trend , poverty in many countries has remained constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate was 48% in 1981 . According to the Kenya Poverty and Inequality Assessment released by the World Bank this year , 17 million Kenyans or 47% of the population were unable to meet the costs of food sufficient to fulfill basic daily caloric requirements . The vast majority of these people live in rural areas and have even less access to the information that impacts their daily life . Data on water quality , education and health budgets , and agricultural prices are nearly impossible to access . <p> Despite hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year on providing basic public services like primary education , health , water , and sanitation to poor communities , poverty in much of Sub-Saharan Africa persists . Where does this money go , who gets it , and what are the results of the resources invested ? That 's where we find a big black hole of information and a lack of basic accountability . How do inputs ( dollars spent ) turn into outputs ( schools , clinics , and wells ) , and , more importantly , how do outputs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , etc . ) ? <p> We simply do n't  know the answers to most of these basic questions . But what if we could ? What if a mother could find out how much money was budgeted for her daughter 's school each year and how much of it was received ? What if she and other parents could report how often teachers are absent from school or whether health clinics have the medicines they are supposed to carry ? What if citizens could access and report on basic information to determine value for money as tax payers ? <p> The work of SODNET in Kenya is illustrative . They are developing a simple budget-tracking tool that allows citizens to track the allocation , use , and ultimate result of government funds earmarked for infrastructure projects in their districts . The tool is intended to create transparency in the use of tax revenues and answer the simple question : Are resources reaching their intended beneficiaries ? Using tools like maps , they are able to overlay information that begins to tell a compelling story . <p> Google.orgs role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to support , catalyze , and widely disseminate this kind of information to public , private , and civil society stakeholders that can use it to see more clearly what 's working , what 's broken and what are potential solutions . Leveraging platforms like Google Earth and Google Maps can help organizations disseminate their content widely and let people see and understand what was once invisible . Once information is visible , widely known , and easy to understand , we are betting that governments and citizens will pay more attention to leakages in the service delivery pipeline and feel empowered to propose solutions . <p> You ca n't change what you cant see . The power to know plus the power to act on what you know is the surest way to achieve positive social change from the bottom up . And when we consider the magnitude of resources invested in delivering public services each year , a 10% improvement globally would exceed the value of all foreign aid . We believe that is a bet worth making .
@@13269113 @1869113/ <h> Thursday 12/18/2008 10:40:00 AM <p> There 's a great deal of talk about the high cost of oil and the billions of dollars that the US and other oil-importing nations spend each year to buy oil . As part of the Google.org Geo Challenge Grants Program , Rocky Mountain Institute ( RMI ) has created a map of US oil imports by country since 1973 . By clicking on the green light to play , you can see the countries supplying oil to the U.S. ( either in terms of barrels or dollar value ) and how our imports have changed over the last 35 years.The thicker the line in the map , the more oil produced or imported . While this map highlights data on United States oil imports , the picture is similar for every oil-importing country in the world . <p> The map highlights 5 eras of oil consumption , from the oil shocks of the 1970s to the price collapse in the 1980s to recent events including Hurricane Katrina and gas approaching $5 per gallon before retreating rapidly recently . ( You can see these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RMI website . ) One interesting time period is from 1982 to 1985 , when low prices caused oil imports from the Middle East to decline to very low levels . <p> The map also looks at potential oil from offshore drilling and exploration of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) . The screenshot below illustrates the impact of off-shore drilling . With the map zoomed or drilled 3-5 levels down and centered near Alabama ( and the map pushpin that represents offshore ) , check out the very thin line that shows the potential peak production of 220,000 barrels per day.The lines represent estimates of production in 20-30 years , and even with this very long timeline , the amount of oil that could be generated from offshore drilling is miniscule compared to our oil needs today . <p> Both Google and RMI are working hard to help create a future where we are not reliant on daily imports of millions of barrels of oil that pollute our atmosphere and risk our national security . <p> Today , along with the Brookings Institution , RMI is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify solutions to break Americas dependence on oil , with Google in attendance .

In our Clean Energy 2030 Plan we show that increasing conventional automobile mileage , deploying millions of plug-in hybrids and accelerating the turnover of the fleet would reduce oil consumption by 51% by 2030 . That decrease would have an even larger effect on oil imports because we produce about one-third of our oil in the US . Google and RMI have worked together on a number of projects including RMIs Smart GarageCharrette , a summit to identify the barriers and breakthroughs needed to electrify the U.S. auto fleet . <p> While oil prices have declined rapidly over the past five months , most people expect oil prices to remain high into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in oil prices reduces the need to act , President-Elect Barack Obama responded that we go from " shock to trance " and as a result " never make any progress .

The platform will enable scientists to use our extensive computing infrastructurethe Google " cloud " to analyze this imagery . Last year , we demonstrated an early prototype . Since then , we have developed the platform , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Earth Engine to implement their applications . <p> Why is this important ? The images of our planet from space contain a wealth of information , ready to be extracted and applied to many societal challenges . Scientific analysis can transform these images from a mere set of pixels into useful informationsuch as the locations and extent of global forests , detecting how our forests are changing over time , directing resources for disaster response or water resource mapping . <p> The challenge has been to cope with the massive scale of satellite imagery archives , and the computational resources required for their analysis . As a result , many of these images have never been seen , much less analyzed . Now , scientists will be able to build applications to mine this treasure trove of data on Google Earth Engine , providing several advantages : <p> Landsat satellite data archives over the last 25 years for most of the developing world available online , ready to be used together with other datasets including MODIS . And we will soon offer a complete global archive of Landsat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure .

Its part of our broader effort at Google to build a more sustainable future . Were particularly excited about an initial use of Google Earth Engine to support development of systems to monitor , report and verify ( MRV ) efforts to stop global deforestation . <p> Deforestation releases a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere , accounting for 12-18% of annual greenhouse gas emissions .

The United Nations has proposed a framework known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries ) that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests . Reaching an agreement on early development of REDD is a key agenda item here in Cancun . <p> Today , we announced that we are donating 10 million CPU-hours a year over the next two years on the Google Earth Engine platform , to strengthen the capacity of developing world nations to track the state of their forests , in preparation for REDD . For the least developed nations , Google Earth Engine will provide critical access to terabytes of data , a growing set of analytical tools and our high-performance processing capabilities . We believe Google Earth Engine will bring transparency and more certainty to global efforts to stop deforestation . <p> Weve been working with several partners to fully develop this platform . In particular , the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation has been a key strategic and funding partner . The Moore Foundation has also committed over $12 million dollars through its Environmental Conservation Program to projects that support the development of Google Earth Engine . The Moore Foundations Environment Program finances practical , enduring solutions to environmental challenges and works to improve the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal marine ecosystems to create working land and seascapes that support resilient and productive ecosystems for current and future generations . Theyve funded the U.S. Geological Survey to scale their infrastructure and accelerate bringing historic Landsat data off tape , and online , through Google Earth Engine . <p> This animation shows the breadth and depth of the Landsat archive that has been uploaded into Google Earth Engine to date . We are grateful to the USGS for their ongoing technical collaboration . <p> Support from the Moore Foundation includes funding for several scientists to develop and integrate their desktop software to work online with the data available in Google Earth Engine . Those scientists -- Greg Asner of the Carnegie Institution for Science and Carlos Souza of Imazon -- are also key partners , along with Matt Hansen of the Geographic Information Science Center at South Dakota State University . All are at the cutting edge of forest monitoring in support of climate science . <p> In collaboration with Matt Hansen and CONAFOR , Mexicos National Forestry Commission , we 've produced a forest cover and water map of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date . The map required 15,000 hours of computation , but was completed in less than a day on Google Earth Engine , using 1,000 computers over more than 53,000 Landsat scenes ( 1984-2010 ) . CONAFOR provided National Forest Inventory ground-sampled data to calibrate and validate the algorithm . <p> A forest cover and water map of Mexico ( southern portion , including the Yucatan peninsula ) , produced in collaboration with scientist Matthew Hansen and CONAFOR . <p> We hope that Google Earth Engine will be an important tool to help institutions around the world manage forests more wisely . As we fully develop the platform , we hope more scientists will use new Earth Engine API to integrate their applications onlinefor deforestation , disease mitigation , disaster response , water resource mapping and other beneficial uses .

I was talking to women in my community about their problems : hunger , access to water , poverty , wood fuel .

" Trees hold the soil to the ground so that we can grow food in it , they protect watersheds and facilitate harvesting of rain water , fruits trees supplement food and trees give us domestic energy and wood with which to build our shelters . So while still working at the University of Nairobi , I established a tree nursery in my backyard , planted seven trees at a public park and founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , to build their capacity to restore Africa 's forests and put an end to the problems that deforestation and other forms of environmental degradation cause .

For accuracy and integrity we worked very closely with Google , advising them on the modeling of unique African trees like the broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia . These tree models illustrate the biodiversity in our tree planting sites , especially in the forests , and how we carefully select trees that are indigenous and sustainable to the natural surroundings . <p> Broad-leaved Croton , the Nile tulip tree and the East African Cordia ( from left to right ) <p> We then used data from real planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth and create 3D visualizations .

It helps people come together to address common problems and work collectively towards community improvement and sustainability . I hope that seeing our beautiful tree planting sites in 3D on Google Earth will be a source of inspiration for people to engage , plant trees and organize planting activities in their own communities . Taking charge of our lives and the environment around us can help ensure a lasting legacy and healthy future for our children .

In contrast to the research that Alix and I refer to , Whittington 's challenge paper is more pessimistic about whether water and sanitation interventions are the best use of scarce resources that are supposed to improve the lives of the poor . They base this claim mostly on the expense of the technologies they consider ( wells , piped water and sewerage ) . <p> In our review , Alix and I argue that a key reason that water services are not working for the poor is the same reason why other public services are failing the poor : a lack of accountability between providers , policymakers , and consumers that has resulted in bad management and governance .

@@13269120 @1869120/ <h> Wednesday 10/01/2008 10:33:00 AM <p> Right now the U.S. has a very real opportunity to transform our economy from one running on fossil fuels to one largely based on clean energy . We are developing the technologies and know-how to accomplish this . We can build whole new industries and create millions of new jobs . We can reduce energy costs , both at the gas pump and at home . We can improve our national security . And we can put a big dent in climate change . With strong leadership we could be moving forward on an aggressive but realistic timeline and an approach that balances costs with real economic gains . <p> The energy team at Google has been crunching the numbers to see how we could greatly reduce fossil fuel use by 2030 . Our analysis , led by Jeffery Greenblatt , suggests a potential path to weaning the U.S. off of coal and oil for electricity generation by 2030 ( with some remaining use of natural gas as well as nuclear ) , and cutting oil use for cars by 40% . Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting us to carbon-free electricity even sooner . We hope the American public pushes our leaders to embrace it . T. Boone Pickens has weighed in with an interesting plan of his own to massively deploy wind energy , among other things . Other plans have also been developed in recent years that merit attention . <p> Our goal in presenting this first iteration of the Clean Energy 2030 proposal is to stimulate debate and we invite you to take a look and comment - or offer an alternative approach if you disagree . With a new Administration and Congress - and multiple energy-related imperatives - this is an opportune , perhaps unprecedented , moment to move from plan to action . <p> Over 22 years this plan could generate billions of dollars in savings and help create millions of green jobs . Many of these high quality , good-paying jobs will be in today 's coal and oil producing states . <p> To get there we need immediate action on three fronts : <p> ( 1 ) Reduce demand by doing more with less <p> We should start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency -- adopting technologies and practices that allow us to do more with less . At Google , we 've seen the benefits of this approach . We identified $5M in building efficiency investments with a 2.5 year payback . We 've also designed our own data centers to run more efficiently , and we believe they are the most efficient in the world . On a smaller scale , personal computers can also become much more efficient . A typical desktop PC wastes nearly half the power it consumes . Last year , Bill Weihl , our Green Energy Czar , worked with industry partners to create the Climate Savers Computing Initiative to raise energy efficiency standards for personal computers and servers . If we meet our goals , these standards will cut energy consumption by the equivalent of 10-20 coal-fired power plants by 2010 . <p> Government can have a big impact on achieving greater efficiency . California 's aggressive building codes , efficiency standards and utility programs have helped the state keep per-capita energy use flat for years , while consumption in much of the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national level would help even more . <p> We also need to give the American people opportunities to be more efficient . The way we buy electricity today is like going to a store without seeing prices : we pick what we want , and receive an unintelligible bill at the end of the month . When homes are equipped with smart meters and real-time pricing , research shows that energy use typically drops . Google is looking at ways that we can use our information technology and our reach to help increase awareness and bring better , real-time information to consumers . <p> ( 2 ) Develop renewable energy that is cheaper than coal ( RE&lt;C ) <p> Googles data centers draw from a U.S. electricity grid that relies on coal for 50% of its power . We want to help catalyze the development of renewable energy that is price competitive with coal . At least three technologies show tremendous promise : wind , solar thermal , and advanced geothermal . Each of these is abundant and , when combined , could supply energy in virtually every region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $45 million in startup companies with breakthrough wind , solar and geothermal technologies through our Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal ( RE&lt;C ) initiative , but that is a drop when we need a flood . We need to unleash massive private investment in clean energy . The government can have a big impact here as well . We must dramatically increase federal R&amp;D and enact measures supporting the rapid deployment and scaling of clean technologies such as long-term tax support and a national renewable energy standard . Tax credits for wind and solar have lapsed several times in the last 20 years , starving these nascent industries of the capital they need to truly enter the mainstream . <p> We also must work both sides of the RE&lt;C equation . Progress will be accelerated when the price of carbon reflects its true costs to society . Putting a price on carbon through cap-and-trade or a carbon tax would help address this . <p> ( 3 ) Electrify transportation and re-invent our electric grid <p> Imagine driving a car that uses no gas and is less expensive to recharge than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to charge when electricity is cheap , and maybe even make some money by selling unused power back to the grid when it 's needed . Plug-in cars are on their way , with GM , Toyota and other manufacturers planning introductions in the next two years . At Google we have a small fleet of Toyota Prius and Ford Escape plug-in conversions , as a part of our RechargeIT program . The converted Prius plug-ins get over 90 MPG , and the Escapes close to 50 MPG . However to successfully put millions of plug-in cars on the road and and fuel them with green electricity , we need a smart grid that manages when we charge and how we 're billed . A smart grid could also provide for the two-way flow of electricity , as well as large-scale integration of intermittent solar and wind energy . Much of the technology in our current electrical grid was developed in the 60s and is wasteful and not very smart . We are partnering with GE to help accelerate the development of the smart grid and support building new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . <p> We see a huge opportunity for the nation to confront our energy challenges .

Young women still trudge the kilometers to the river , at risk to their own security , to collect water . Bright blue toilet stalls line the periphery of a girls school .

The Bali action plan provides a roadmap for negotiating an expanded and strengthened international emissions reduction pact by the end of 2009 . <p> The deal leaves many contentious issues unresolved . It does not include any explicit emissions reductions goals or targets ; in fact the scientific recommendations on the emissions reductions needed to halt climate change are relegated to a footnote . The plan simply lays out a process to negotiate the emissions targets to succeed the limits set by Kyoto Protocol , which expire in 2012 . It also provides a platform to begin talks to address growing concerns about adaption , deforestation and facilitating transfer of clean technologies to developing countries . <p> At the outset of this conference , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands collective action by the world 's governments . The Bali roadmap , while leaving much to be desired , represents an important step in this process . All the parties are still at the table and are now committed to spending the next two years crafting a more comprehensive global solution to fighting climate change . Many were hopeful that the outcome of the U.S. Presidential election in 2008 will help breathe new life into this process , regardless of whether the President-elect is a Republican or Democrat . <p> But given how difficult it was to reach an agreement in Bali and how acrimonious the negotiations were , the rest of us ca n't afford to wait for the world to negotiate a new climate agreement . We need to take action now . Fortunately , many people around the world are doing just that . The numerous panels and side events at Bali were filled with examples of concrete actions people are taking now to build a cleaner future . We wrote on how the world 's local governments are launching their own initiatives to fight global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions take into account equity and justice considerations . Another hot topic of conversation here was the growing efforts of many companies to reduce their carbon footprints and take a leadership role in promoting smart energy policies . <p> The flurry of activity among all of these groups is encouraging . The result at Bali and the tough road ahead suggests that the international treaty process will not be sufficient to confront this challenge with the speed and scope with which it demands , at least in the short term . To stop climate change , we all must take responsibility and act , whether by making choices to reduce our personal carbon footprint , engaging with family and friends in our communities , or elevating the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda . For the Google.org team , it means a renewed commitment to putting our own resources to work .
